                     For our advantage on the bitter cross.

                     My liege, I did deny no prisoners.

                     Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;

                     And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held

                     He gave his nose and took't away again;

                     Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,

                     He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,

                     He should or he should not; for he made me mad

                     And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman

                     And that it was great pity, so it was,

                     This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd

                     That wished him on the barren mountains starve.

                     Of this proud king, who studies day and night
                  
                <br />

                     But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And dress'd myself in such humility
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Even in the presence of the crowned king.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     My presence, like a robe pontifical,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And won by rareness such solemnity.

                     The skipping king, he ambled up and down
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,

                     Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Had his great name profaned with their scorns

                     And gave his countenance, against his name,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
                  
                <br />

                     Grew a companion to the common streets,

                     Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;

                     More than a little is by much too much.

                     So when he had occasion to be seen,
                  
                <br />

                     Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes

                     As, sick and blunted with community,

                     Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;

                     Slept in his face and render'd such aspect

                     As cloudy men use to their adversaries,

                     Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.

                     And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;

                     For thou has lost thy princely privilege

                     With vile participation: not an eye

                     But is a-weary of thy common sight,

                     Some certain edicts and some strait decrees

                     Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
