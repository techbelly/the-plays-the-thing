  <h1>The Tragedy of King Lear</h1>
<div class="act">
<h2>ACT I</h2>
<div class="scene">
<h3>SCENE I.  King Lear's palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
<br />
Albany than Cornwall.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
<br />
division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
<br />
the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
<br />
weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
<br />
of either's moiety.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Is not this your son, my lord?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
<br />
so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
<br />
brazed to it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
I cannot conceive you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
<br />
she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
<br />
for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
<br />
Do you smell a fault?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
<br />
being so proper.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
<br />
elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
<br />
though this knave came something saucily into the
<br />
world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
<br />
fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
<br />
whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
<br />
noble gentleman, Edmund?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
No, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
<br />
honourable friend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
My services to your lordship.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
I must love you, and sue to know you better.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
Sir, I shall study deserving.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
<br />
again. The king is coming.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY,
GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I shall, my liege.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
<br />
Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
<br />
In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
<br />
To shake all cares and business from our age;
<br />
Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
<br />
Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
<br />
And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
<br />
We have this hour a constant will to publish
<br />
Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
<br />
May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
<br />
Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
<br />
Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
<br />
And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
<br />
Since now we will divest us both of rule,
<br />
Interest of territory, cares of state,--
<br />
Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
<br />
That we our largest bounty may extend
<br />
Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
<br />
Our eldest-born, speak first.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
<br />
Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
<br />
Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
<br />
No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
<br />
As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
<br />
A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
<br />
Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
What shall Cordelia do?
<br />
Love, and be silent.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LEAR</b>
Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
<br />
With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
<br />
With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
<br />
We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
<br />
Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
<br />
Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
Sir, I am made
<br />
Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
<br />
And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
<br />
I find she names my very deed of love;
<br />
Only she comes too short: that I profess
<br />
Myself an enemy to all other joys,
<br />
Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
<br />
And find I am alone felicitate
<br />
In your dear highness' love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
Then poor Cordelia!
<br />
And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
<br />
More richer than my tongue.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
To thee and thine hereditary ever
<br />
Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
<br />
No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
<br />
Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
<br />
Although the last, not least; to whose young love
<br />
The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
<br />
Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
<br />
A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
Nothing, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Nothing!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
Nothing.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
<br />
My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
<br />
According to my bond; nor more nor less.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
<br />
Lest it may mar your fortunes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
Good my lord,
<br />
You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
<br />
Return those duties back as are right fit,
<br />
Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
<br />
Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
<br />
They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
<br />
That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
<br />
Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
<br />
Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
<br />
To love my father all.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
But goes thy heart with this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
Ay, good my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
So young, and so untender?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
So young, my lord, and true.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
<br />
For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
<br />
The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
<br />
By all the operation of the orbs
<br />
From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
<br />
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
<br />
Propinquity and property of blood,
<br />
And as a stranger to my heart and me
<br />
Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
<br />
Or he that makes his generation messes
<br />
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
<br />
Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
<br />
As thou my sometime daughter.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Good my liege,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Peace, Kent!
<br />
Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
<br />
I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
<br />
On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
<br />
So be my grave my peace, as here I give
<br />
Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
<br />
Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
<br />
With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
<br />
Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
<br />
I do invest you jointly with my power,
<br />
Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
<br />
That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
<br />
With reservation of an hundred knights,
<br />
By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
<br />
Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
<br />
The name, and all the additions to a king;
<br />
The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
<br />
Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
<br />
This coronet part betwixt you.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Giving the crown</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Royal Lear,
<br />
Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
<br />
Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
<br />
As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
<br />
The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
<br />
When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
<br />
Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
<br />
When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
<br />
When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
<br />
And, in thy best consideration, cheque
<br />
This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
<br />
Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
<br />
Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
<br />
Reverbs no hollowness.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Kent, on thy life, no more.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
My life I never held but as a pawn
<br />
To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
<br />
Thy safety being the motive.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Out of my sight!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
See better, Lear; and let me still remain
<br />
The true blank of thine eye.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Now, by Apollo,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Now, by Apollo, king,
<br />
Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
O, vassal! miscreant!
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Laying his hand on his sword</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Dear sir, forbear.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Do:
<br />
Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
<br />
Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
<br />
Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
<br />
I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Hear me, recreant!
<br />
On thine allegiance, hear me!
<br />
Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
<br />
Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
<br />
To come between our sentence and our power,
<br />
Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
<br />
Our potency made good, take thy reward.
<br />
Five days we do allot thee, for provision
<br />
To shield thee from diseases of the world;
<br />
And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
<br />
Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
<br />
Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
<br />
The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
<br />
This shall not be revoked.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
<br />
Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To CORDELIA</i><br />
The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
<br />
That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To REGAN and GONERIL</i><br />
And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
<br />
That good effects may spring from words of love.
<br />
Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
<br />
He'll shape his old course in a country new.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p class="stagedir">Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE,
BURGUNDY, and Attendants</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
My lord of Burgundy.
<br />
We first address towards you, who with this king
<br />
Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
<br />
Will you require in present dower with her,
<br />
Or cease your quest of love?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BURGUNDY</b>
Most royal majesty,
<br />
I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
<br />
Nor will you tender less.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Right noble Burgundy,
<br />
When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
<br />
But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
<br />
If aught within that little seeming substance,
<br />
Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
<br />
And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
<br />
She's there, and she is yours.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BURGUNDY</b>
I know no answer.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
<br />
Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
<br />
Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
<br />
Take her, or leave her?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BURGUNDY</b>
Pardon me, royal sir;
<br />
Election makes not up on such conditions.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
<br />
I tell you all her wealth.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To KING OF FRANCE</i><br />
For you, great king,
<br />
I would not from your love make such a stray,
<br />
To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
<br />
To avert your liking a more worthier way
<br />
Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
<br />
Almost to acknowledge hers.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING OF FRANCE</b>
This is most strange,
<br />
That she, that even but now was your best object,
<br />
The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
<br />
Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
<br />
Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
<br />
So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
<br />
Must be of such unnatural degree,
<br />
That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
<br />
Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
<br />
Must be a faith that reason without miracle
<br />
Could never plant in me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
I yet beseech your majesty,--
<br />
If for I want that glib and oily art,
<br />
To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
<br />
I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
<br />
It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
<br />
No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
<br />
That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
<br />
But even for want of that for which I am richer,
<br />
A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
<br />
As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
<br />
Hath lost me in your liking.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Better thou
<br />
Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING OF FRANCE</b>
Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
<br />
Which often leaves the history unspoke
<br />
That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
<br />
What say you to the lady? Love's not love
<br />
When it is mingled with regards that stand
<br />
Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
<br />
She is herself a dowry.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BURGUNDY</b>
Royal Lear,
<br />
Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
<br />
And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
<br />
Duchess of Burgundy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BURGUNDY</b>
I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
<br />
That you must lose a husband.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
Peace be with Burgundy!
<br />
Since that respects of fortune are his love,
<br />
I shall not be his wife.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING OF FRANCE</b>
Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
<br />
Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
<br />
Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
<br />
Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
<br />
Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
<br />
My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
<br />
Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
<br />
Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
<br />
Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
<br />
Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
<br />
Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
<br />
Thou losest here, a better where to find.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
<br />
Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
<br />
That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
<br />
Without our grace, our love, our benison.
<br />
Come, noble Burgundy.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL,
REGAN, and CORDELIA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING OF FRANCE</b>
Bid farewell to your sisters.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
<br />
Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
<br />
And like a sister am most loath to call
<br />
Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
<br />
To your professed bosoms I commit him
<br />
But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
<br />
I would prefer him to a better place.
<br />
So, farewell to you both.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
Prescribe not us our duties.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
Let your study
<br />
Be to content your lord, who hath received you
<br />
At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
<br />
And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORDELIA</b>
Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
<br />
Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
<br />
Well may you prosper!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING OF FRANCE</b>
Come, my fair Cordelia.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
<br />
most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
<br />
father will hence to-night.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
You see how full of changes his age is; the
<br />
observation we have made of it hath not been
<br />
little: he always loved our sister most; and
<br />
with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
<br />
appears too grossly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
<br />
but slenderly known himself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
The best and soundest of his time hath been but
<br />
rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
<br />
not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
<br />
condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
<br />
that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
<br />
him as this of Kent's banishment.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
There is further compliment of leavetaking
<br />
between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
<br />
together: if our father carry authority with
<br />
such dispositions as he bears, this last
<br />
surrender of his will but offend us.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
We shall further think on't.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
We must do something, and i' the heat.

<h3>SCENE II.  The Earl of Gloucester's castle. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter EDMUND, with a letter</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
<br />
My services are bound. Wherefore should I
<br />
Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
<br />
The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
<br />
For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
<br />
Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
<br />
When my dimensions are as well compact,
<br />
My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
<br />
As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
<br />
With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
<br />
Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
<br />
More composition and fierce quality
<br />
Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
<br />
Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
<br />
Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
<br />
Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
<br />
Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
<br />
As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!

Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,

'This policy and reverence of age makes

in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not

as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to

me, that of this I may speak more. If our father

Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you

gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the

These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
<br />
no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
<br />
reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
<br />
scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
<br />
friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
<br />
cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
<br />
palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
<br />
and father. This villain of mine comes under the
<br />
prediction; there's son against father: the king
<br />
falls from bias of nature; there's father against
<br />
child. We have seen the best of our time:
<br />
machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
<br />
ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
<br />
graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
<br />
lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
<br />
noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
<br />
offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.

This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
<br />
when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
<br />
of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
<br />
disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
<br />
if we were villains by necessity; fools by
<br />
heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
<br />
treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
<br />
liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
<br />
planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
<br />
by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
<br />
of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
<br />
disposition to the charge of a star! My
<br />
father compounded with my mother under the
<br />
dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa

major; so that it follows, I am rough and

lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,

</p>

unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child

<br />
ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and

maledictions against king and nobles; needless

diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation

of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.

Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended

him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence

his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth

<p>

Some villain hath done me wrong.

That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent

slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my

No, lad; teach me.

</p>
<p>

That lord that counsell'd thee

Come place him here by me,
<br />
Do thou for him stand:
<br />
The sweet and bitter fool
<br />
Will presently appear;
<br />
The one in motley here,
<br />
The other found out there.

This is not altogether fool, my lord.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Fool</b>
No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if
<br />
I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:
<br />
and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool

to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,

What two crowns shall they be?
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">Fool</b>
Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat
<br />
up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
<br />
clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
<br />
both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
<br />
the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
<br />
when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak

Then they for sudden joy did weep,
<br />
And I for sorrow sung,

That such a king should play bo-peep,
<br />
And go the fools among.
<br />
Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
<br />
thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.

<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:

they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt

have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am
<br />
whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
<br />
kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
<br />
thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,

I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
<br />
To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
<br />
By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
<br />
That you protect this course, and put it on

By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
<br />
Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,

Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,

Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;

Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,

That this our court, infected with their manners,

For instant remedy: be then desired

By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
<br />
A little to disquantity your train;

And the remainder, that shall still depend,

Create her child of spleen; that it may live,

Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;

With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;

Turn all her mother's pains and benefits

<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
<br />
But that I told him, the revenging gods
<br />
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
<br />
Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
<br />
The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
<br />
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
<br />
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
<br />
With his prepared sword, he charges home
<br />
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
<br />
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
<br />
Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
<br />
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
<br />
Full suddenly he fled.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Let him fly far:
<br />
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
<br />
And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
<br />
My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
<br />
By his authority I will proclaim it,
<br />
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
<br />
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
<br />
He that conceals him, death.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
When I dissuaded him from his intent,
<br />
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
<br />
I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
<br />
'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
<br />
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
<br />
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
<br />
Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
<br />
As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
<br />
My very character,--I'ld turn it all
<br />
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
<br />
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
<br />
If they not thought the profits of my death
<br />
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
<br />
To make thee seek it.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Strong and fasten'd villain
<br />
Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Tucket within</i><br />
Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
<br />
All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
<br />
The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
<br />
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
<br />
May have the due note of him; and of my land,
<br />
Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
<br />
To make thee capable.
<br />

<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,

Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.

O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
<br />
</p>
<p>

What, did my father's godson seek your life?
<br />
He whom my father named? your Edgar?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
Was he not companion with the riotous knights

That tend upon my father?

<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
<br />
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
<br />
To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
<br />
I have this present evening from my sister
<br />
Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
<br />
That if they come to sojourn at my house,
<br />
I'll not be there.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
<br />
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
<br />
A child-like office.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
'Twas my duty, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
He did bewray his practise; and received
<br />
This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Is he pursued?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Ay, my good lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
If he be taken, he shall never more
<br />
Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
<br />
How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
<br />
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
<br />
So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
<br />
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
<br />
You we first seize on.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
I shall serve you, sir,
<br />
Truly, however else.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
For him I thank your grace.
<br />
</p>

You know not why we came to visit you,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:
<br />
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
<br />
Wherein we must have use of your advice:
<br />
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
<br />
Of differences, which I least thought it fit
<br />
To answer from our home; the several messengers
<br />
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
<br />
Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
<br />
Your needful counsel to our business,
<br />
Which craves the instant use.

Your graces are right welcome.

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OSWALD</b>
What dost thou know me for?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a

base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
<br />
hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
<br />
lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
<br />
glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
<br />
one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
<br />
bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
<br />
the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
<br />
and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
<br />
will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
<br />
the least syllable of thy addition.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OSWALD</b>
Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail

on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou

<b class="speaker">OSWALD</b>
I am scarce in breath, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You

cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
<br />
not have made him so ill, though he had been but two

hours at the trade.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?

This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared

<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My

lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this

a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?
<br />
</p>

<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Peace, sirrah!
<br />
You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Why art thou angry?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
<br />
Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
<br />
Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
<br />
Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
<br />
That in the natures of their lords rebel;
<br />
Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
<br />
Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
<br />
With every gale and vary of their masters,
<br />
Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
<br />
A plague upon your epileptic visage!
<br />
Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
<br />
Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
<br />
I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
How fell you out? say that.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
No contraries hold more antipathy
<br />
Than I and such a knave.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
His countenance likes me not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
<br />
I have seen better faces in my time
<br />
Than stands on any shoulder that I see
<br />
Before me at this instant.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
This is some fellow,
<br />
Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
<br />
A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
<br />
Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
<br />
An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
<br />
An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
<br />
These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
<br />
Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
<br />
Than twenty silly ducking observants
<br />
That stretch their duties nicely.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
<br />
Under the allowance of your great aspect,
<br />
Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
<br />
On flickering Phoebus' front,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
What mean'st by this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
To go out of my dialect, which you
<br />
discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
<br />
flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
<br />
accent was a plain knave; which for my part
<br />
I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
<br />
to entreat me to 't.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
What was the offence you gave him?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OSWALD</b>
I never gave him any:
<br />
It pleased the king his master very late
<br />
To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
<br />
When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
<br />
Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
<br />
And put upon him such a deal of man,
<br />
That worthied him, got praises of the king
<br />
For him attempting who was self-subdued;
<br />
And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
<br />
Drew on me here again.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
None of these rogues and cowards
<br />
But Ajax is their fool.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Fetch forth the stocks!
<br />
You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
<br />
We'll teach you--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Sir, I am too old to learn:
<br />
Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
<br />
On whose employment I was sent to you:
<br />
You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
<br />
Against the grace and person of my master,
<br />
Stocking his messenger.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
<br />
There shall he sit till noon.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
<br />
You should not use me so.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
Sir, being his knave, I will.

<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
<br />
His fault is much, and the good king his master

For pilferings and most common trespasses

<br />
That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,

<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
I'll answer that.

<br />
My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
<br />
Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
<br />
From Goneril his mistress salutations;
<br />
Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
<br />
Which presently they read: on whose contents,
<br />
They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
<br />
Commanded me to follow, and attend
<br />
The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
<br />
And meeting here the other messenger,
<br />
Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
<br />
Being the very fellow that of late
<br />
Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
<br />
Having more man than wit about me, drew:
<br />
He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
<br />
Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
<br />
The shame which here it suffers.

Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.
<br />
Fathers that wear rags
<br />
Do make their children blind;
<br />
But fathers that bear bags
<br />
Shall see their children kind.
<br />
Fortune, that arrant whore,
<br />
Ne'er turns the key to the poor.
<br />
But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
<br />
for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
<br />
Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
<br />
Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
With the earl, sir, here within.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Follow me not;
<br />
Stay here.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
None.
<br />
How chance the king comes with so small a train?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Fool</b>
And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
<br />
question, thou hadst well deserved it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Why, fool?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Fool</b>
We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee
<br />
there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
<br />
their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
<br />
there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
<br />
that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
<br />
runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
<br />
following it: but the great one that goes up the
<br />
hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
<br />
gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
<br />
would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
<br />
That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
<br />
And follows but for form,
<br />
Will pack when it begins to rain,
<br />
And leave thee in the storm,
<br />
But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
<br />
And let the wise man fly:
<br />
The knave turns fool that runs away;
<br />
The fool no knave, perdy.
<br />

In his own course.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
<br />
Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
<br />
I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Ay, my good lord.

The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father

Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
<br />
Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
<br />
Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
<br />
No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
<br />
Infirmity doth still neglect all office
<br />
Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
<br />
When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
<br />
To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;

And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
<br />
To take the indisposed and sickly fit

<br />
Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,

Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum

Regan, I think you are; I know what reason

I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
<br />
I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
<br />
Sepulchring an adultress.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To KENT</i><br />
O, are you free?
<br />
Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
<br />
Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied

Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Points to his heart</i><br />
I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe

I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.
<br />
You less know how to value her desert

Than she to scant her duty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Say, how is that?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
I cannot think my sister in the least

Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance

She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,

'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,

As clears her from all blame.

</p>

<br />
</p>

<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
O, sir, you are old.
<br />
Nature in you stands on the very verge

Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
<br />
By some discretion, that discerns your state
<br />
Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
<br />
That to our sister you do make return;
<br />
Say you have wrong'd her, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>

Do you but mark how this becomes the house:

'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;

<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Rising</i>
Never, Regan:
<br />
She hath abated me of half my train;
<br />
Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
<br />
Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
<br />
All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
<br />
On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
<br />
You taking airs, with lameness!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">CORNWALL</b>
Fie, sir, fie!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
<br />
Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
<br />
You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
<br />
To fall and blast her pride!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
<br />
When the rash mood is on.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
<br />
Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
<br />
Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
<br />
Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
<br />
To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
<br />
To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
<br />
And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
<br />
Against my coming in: thou better know'st
<br />
The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
<br />
Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
<br />
Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,

Wherein I thee endow'd.

Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
<br />
O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
<br />
</p>
<p>

Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
<br />
All's not offence that indiscretion finds

And dotage terms so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
O sides, you are too tough;
<br />
Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?

I set him there, sir: but his own disorders

You! did you?
<br />
</p>
<p>

I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
<br />
If, till the expiration of your month,
<br />
You will return and sojourn with my sister,
<br />
Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
<br />
I am now from home, and out of that provision
<br />
Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
<br />
No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
<br />
To wage against the enmity o' the air;
<br />
To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
<br />
Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
<br />
Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
<br />
Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
<br />
To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg
<br />
To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
<br />
Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
<br />
To this detested groom.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Pointing at OSWALD</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
At your choice, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
<br />
I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
<br />
We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
<br />
But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
<br />
Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
<br />
Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
<br />
A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
<br />
In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
<br />
Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
<br />
I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
<br />
Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
<br />
Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
<br />
I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
<br />
I and my hundred knights.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
Not altogether so:
<br />
I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
<br />
For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
<br />
For those that mingle reason with your passion
<br />
Must be content to think you old, and so--
<br />
But she knows what she does.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Is this well spoken?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
<br />
Is it not well? What should you need of more?
<br />
Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
<br />
Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
<br />
Should many people, under two commands,
<br />
Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
<br />
From those that she calls servants or from mine?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
<br />
We could control them. If you will come to me,--
<br />
For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
<br />
To bring but five and twenty: to no more
<br />
Will I give place or notice.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
I gave you all--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
And in good time you gave it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
<br />
But kept a reservation to be follow'd
<br />
With such a number. What, must I come to you
<br />
With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
<br />
When others are more wicked: not being the worst
<br />
Stands in some rank of praise.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To GONERIL</i><br />
I'll go with thee:
<br />
Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
<br />
And thou art twice her love.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
Hear me, my lord;
<br />
What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
<br />
To follow in a house where twice so many
<br />
Have a command to tend you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">REGAN</b>
What need one?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
<br />
Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
<br />
Allow not nature more than nature needs,
<br />
Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
<br />
If only to go warm were gorgeous,
<br />
Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
<br />
Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
<br />
You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
<br />
You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
<br />
As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
<br />
If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
<br />
Against their father, fool me not so much
<br />
To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
<br />
And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
<br />
Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
<br />
I will have such revenges on you both,
<br />
That all the world shall--I will do such things,--
<br />
What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
<br />
The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
<br />
No, I'll not weep:
<br />
I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
<br />
Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
<br />
Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!

<h3>SCENE I.  A heath. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting</p>

<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Who's there, besides foul weather?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
I know you. Where's the king?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
Contending with the fretful element:
<br />
Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
<br />
Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
<br />
That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
<br />
Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
<br />
Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
<br />
Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
<br />
The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
<br />
This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
<br />
The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
<br />
Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Sir, I do know you;
<br />
And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
<br />
Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
<br />
Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
<br />
With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
<br />
Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
<br />
Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
<br />
Which are to France the spies and speculations
<br />
Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
<br />
Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
<br />
Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
<br />
Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
<br />
Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
<br />
But, true it is, from France there comes a power
<br />
Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
<br />
Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
<br />
In some of our best ports, and are at point
<br />
To show their open banner. Now to you:
<br />
If on my credit you dare build so far
<br />
To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
<br />
Some that will thank you, making just report
<br />
Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
<br />
The king hath cause to plain.
<br />
I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
<br />
And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
<br />
This office to you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
I will talk further with you.

I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:

When priests are more in word than matter;

When brewers mar their malt with water;
<br />
When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
<br />
No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
<br />
When every case in law is right;
<br />
No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
<br />
When slanders do not live in tongues;
<br />
Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
<br />
When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
<br />
And bawds and whores do churches build;
<br />
Then shall the realm of Albion
<br />
Come to great confusion:
<br />
Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
<br />
That going shall be used with feet.

This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman

out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of

That slaves your ordinance, that will not see

Madam, within; but never man so changed.
<br />
I told him of the army that was landed;

He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
<br />
His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
<br />
And of the loyal service of his son,
<br />
When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
<br />
And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:

What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;

What like, offensive.

Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
<br />
May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
<br />
Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
<br />
I must change arms at home, and give the distaff

Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant

That nature, which contemns its origin,

Cannot be border'd certain in itself;

Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,

Could my good brother suffer you to do it?

A man, a prince, by him so benefited!

If that the heavens do not their visible spirits

<h3>SCENE III.  The French camp near Dover. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter KENT and a Gentleman</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
<br />
know you the reason?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
Something he left imperfect in the
<br />
state, which since his coming forth is thought
<br />
of; which imports to the kingdom so much
<br />
fear and danger, that his personal return was
<br />
most required and necessary.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Who hath he left behind him general?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Did your letters pierce the queen to any
<br />
demonstration of grief?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
<br />
And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
<br />
Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
<br />
Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
<br />
Sought to be king o'er her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
O, then it moved her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
<br />
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
<br />
Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
<br />
Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
<br />
That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
<br />
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
<br />
As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
<br />
Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
<br />
If all could so become it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Made she no verbal question?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
<br />
Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
<br />
Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
<br />
Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
<br />
Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
<br />
The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
<br />
And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
<br />
To deal with grief alone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
It is the stars,
<br />
The stars above us, govern our conditions;
<br />
Else one self mate and mate could not beget

No.

No, since.

Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;

Will yield to see his daughter.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
Why, good sir?

A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
<br />
That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
<br />
To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
<br />
To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
<br />
His mind so venomously, that burning shame
<br />
Detains him from Cordelia.

Alack, poor gentleman!

Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,

And leave you to attend him: some dear cause

The treasury of life, when life itself
<br />
Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
<br />
By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
<br />
Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
<br />
Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
<br />
What are you, sir?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Away, and let me die.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
<br />
So many fathom down precipitating,
<br />
Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
<br />
Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
<br />
Ten masts at each make not the altitude
<br />
Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
<br />
Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
But have I fall'n, or no?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
<br />
Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
<br />
Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Alack, I have no eyes.
<br />
Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
<br />
To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
<br />
When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
<br />
And frustrate his proud will.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Give me your arm:
<br />
Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Too well, too well.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
This is above all strangeness.
<br />
Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
<br />
Which parted from you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
A poor unfortunate beggar.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
As I stood here below, methought his eyes
<br />
Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
<br />
Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
<br />
It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
<br />
Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
<br />
Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
<br />
Affliction till it do cry out itself
<br />
'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
<br />
I took it for a man; often 'twould say
<br />
'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers</i><br />
The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
<br />
His master thus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the
<br />
king himself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
O thou side-piercing sight!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
<br />
press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
<br />
crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
<br />
look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
<br />
cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
<br />
it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
<br />
flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
<br />
Give the word.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Sweet marjoram.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Pass.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I know that voice.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
<br />
me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
<br />
beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
<br />
and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
<br />
too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
<br />
wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
<br />
the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
<br />
found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are
<br />
not men o' their words: they told me I was every
<br />
thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
The trick of that voice I do well remember:
<br />
Is 't not the king?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Ay, every inch a king:
<br />
When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
<br />
I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
<br />
Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
<br />
The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
<br />
Does lecher in my sight.
<br />
Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
<br />
Was kinder to his father than my daughters
<br />
Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
<br />
To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
<br />
Behold yond simpering dame,
<br />
Whose face between her forks presages snow;
<br />
That minces virtue, and does shake the head
<br />
To hear of pleasure's name;
<br />
The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
<br />
With a more riotous appetite.
<br />
Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
<br />
Though women all above:
<br />
But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
<br />
Beneath is all the fiends';
<br />
There's hell, there's darkness, there's the
<br />
sulphurous pit,
<br />
Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,
<br />
fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
<br />
good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:
<br />
there's money for thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
O, let me kiss that hand!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
<br />
</p>
<p>

O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
<br />
Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
<br />
at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not
<br />
love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
<br />
penning of it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
I would not take this from report; it is,

And my heart breaks at it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Read.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
What, with the case of eyes?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
<br />
head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
<br />
a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how
<br />
this world goes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
I see it feelingly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes
<br />
with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
<br />
justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
<br />
thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
<br />
is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
<br />
a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Ay, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
And the creature run from the cur? There thou
<br />
mightst behold the great image of authority: a
<br />
dog's obeyed in office.
<br />
Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
<br />
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
<br />
Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
<br />
For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
<br />
Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
<br />
Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
<br />
And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
<br />
Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
<br />
None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
<br />
Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
<br />
To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
<br />
And like a scurvy politician, seem
<br />
To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
<br />
Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
<br />
I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
<br />
Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
<br />
Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
<br />
We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
Alack, alack the day!

<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
When we are born, we cry that we are come
<br />
To this great stage of fools: this a good block;
<br />
It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
<br />
A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;

And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,

Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

Good sir,--

But, by your favour,

How near's the other army?

What place this is; and all the skill I have

Remembers not these garments; nor I know not

If you have poison for me, I will drink it.

I know you do not love me; for your sisters

You have some cause, they have not.

Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
<br />
You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
<br />
To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
<br />
Desire him to go in; trouble him no more

Now, sweet lord,

You know the goodness I intend upon you:

Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,

Do you not love my sister?

In honour'd love.

I am doubtful that you have been conjunct

No, by mine honour, madam.

I never shall endure her: dear my lord,

Our very loving sister, well be-met.
<br />
Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
<br />
With others whom the rigor of our state
<br />
Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
<br />
I never yet was valiant: for this business,

It toucheth us, as France invades our land,

Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,

To both these sisters have I sworn my love;

Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
<br />
If both remain alive: to take the widow

Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
<br />
And hardly shall I carry out my side,
<br />
Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
<br />
His countenance for the battle; which being done,
<br />
Let her who would be rid of him devise
<br />
His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
<br />
Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,

The battle done, and they within our power,

Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:

We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:

When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,

And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,

And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh

At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues

Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,

Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,

That were the opposites of this day's strife:

As we shall find their merits and our safety

May equally determine.

<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
Sir, I thought it fit
<br />
To send the old and miserable king
<br />
To some retention and appointed guard;
<br />
Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
<br />
To pluck the common bosom on his side,
<br />
An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
<br />
Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
<br />
My reason all the same; and they are ready
<br />
To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
<br />
Where you shall hold your session. At this time
<br />
We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
<br />
And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
<br />
By those that feel their sharpness:
<br />
The question of Cordelia and her father
<br />
Requires a fitter place.
<br />

Sir, by your patience,

Not as a brother.

That's as we list to grace him.
<br />
Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
<br />
Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;

Bore the commission of my place and person;
<br />
The which immediacy may well stand up,
<br />
And call itself your brother.

Lady, I am not well; else I should answer

Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;

With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;

<br />
Know'st thou this paper?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GONERIL</b>
Ask me not what I know.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
What you have charged me with, that have I done;
<br />
And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
<br />
'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
<br />
That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
<br />
I do forgive thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Let's exchange charity.
<br />
I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
<br />
If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
<br />
My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
<br />
The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
<br />
Make instruments to plague us:
<br />
The dark and vicious place where thee he got
<br />
Cost him his eyes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
<br />
The wheel is come full circle: I am here.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Methought thy very gait did prophesy
<br />
A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
<br />
Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
<br />
Did hate thee or thy father!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Worthy prince, I know't.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Where have you hid yourself?
<br />
How have you known the miseries of your father?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
<br />
And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
<br />
The bloody proclamation to escape,
<br />
That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
<br />
That we the pain of death would hourly die
<br />
Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
<br />
Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
<br />
That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
<br />
Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
<br />
Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
<br />
Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
<br />
Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
<br />
Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
<br />
Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
<br />
I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
<br />
Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
<br />
Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
<br />
'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
<br />
Burst smilingly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
This speech of yours hath moved me,
<br />
And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
<br />
You look as you had something more to say.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
<br />
For I am almost ready to dissolve,
<br />
Hearing of this.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
This would have seem'd a period
<br />
To such as love not sorrow; but another,
<br />
To amplify too much, would make much more,
<br />
And top extremity.
<br />
Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
<br />
Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
<br />
Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
<br />
Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
<br />
He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
<br />
As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
<br />
Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
<br />
That ever ear received: which in recounting
<br />
His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
<br />
Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
<br />
And there I left him tranced.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
But who was this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
<br />
Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
<br />
Improper for a slave.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
Help, help, O, help!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
What kind of help?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Speak, man.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
What means that bloody knife?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
'Tis hot, it smokes;
<br />
It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Who dead? speak, man.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentleman</b>
Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
<br />
By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
I was contracted to them both: all three
<br />
Now marry in an instant.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Here comes Kent.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
<br />
This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
<br />
Touches us not with pity.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exit Gentleman</i><br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter KENT</i><br />
O, is this he?
<br />
The time will not allow the compliment
<br />
Which very manners urges.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
I am come
<br />
To bid my king and master aye good night:
<br />
Is he not here?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Great thing of us forgot!
<br />
Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
<br />
See'st thou this object, Kent?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Alack, why thus?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
Yet Edmund was beloved:
<br />
The one the other poison'd for my sake,
<br />
And after slew herself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Even so. Cover their faces.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
<br />
Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
<br />
Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
<br />
Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
<br />
Nay, send in time.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Run, run, O, run!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
<br />
Thy token of reprieve.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
Well thought on: take my sword,
<br />
Give it the captain.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Haste thee, for thy life.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit EDGAR</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDMUND</b>
He hath commission from thy wife and me
<br />
To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
<br />
To lay the blame upon her own despair,
<br />
That she fordid herself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">EDMUND is borne off</p>
<p class="stagedir">Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms;
EDGAR, Captain, and others following</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:
<br />
Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
<br />
That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
<br />
I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
<br />
She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
<br />
If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
<br />
Why, then she lives.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Is this the promised end
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Or image of that horror?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Fall, and cease!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
<br />
It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
<br />
That ever I have felt.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Kneeling</i>
O my good master!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Prithee, away.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
<br />
I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
<br />
Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
<br />
What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
<br />
Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
<br />
I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
'Tis true, my lords, he did.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Did I not, fellow?
<br />
I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
<br />
I would have made them skip: I am old now,
<br />
And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
<br />
Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
<br />
One of them we behold.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
The same,
<br />
Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
<br />
He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
No, my good lord; I am the very man,--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
I'll see that straight.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
That, from your first of difference and decay,
<br />
Have follow'd your sad steps.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
You are welcome hither.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
<br />
Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
<br />
And desperately are dead.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
Ay, so I think.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
He knows not what he says: and vain it is
<br />
That we present us to him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Very bootless.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter a Captain</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Captain</b>
Edmund is dead, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
That's but a trifle here.
<br />
You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
<br />
What comfort to this great decay may come
<br />
Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
<br />
During the life of this old majesty,
<br />
To him our absolute power:
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To EDGAR and KENT</i><br />
you, to your rights:
<br />
With boot, and such addition as your honours
<br />
Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
<br />
The wages of their virtue, and all foes
<br />
The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING LEAR</b>
And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
<br />
Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
<br />
And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
<br />
Never, never, never, never, never!
<br />
Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
<br />
Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
<br />
Look there, look there!
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Dies</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
He faints! My lord, my lord!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Break, heart; I prithee, break!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
Look up, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
<br />
That would upon the rack of this tough world
<br />
Stretch him out longer.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EDGAR</b>
He is gone, indeed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
<br />
He but usurp'd his life.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
Bear them from hence. Our present business
<br />
Is general woe.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To KENT and EDGAR</i><br />
Friends of my soul, you twain
<br />
Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KENT</b>
I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
<br />
My master calls me, I must not say no.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALBANY</b>
The weight of this sad time we must obey;
<br />
Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
<br />
The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
<br />
Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
<br />
