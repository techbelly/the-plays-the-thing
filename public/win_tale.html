                     What was my first? it has an elder sister,

                     Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,

                     So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,

                     Like very sanctity, she did approach
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon

                     Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,

                     This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:

                     And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,

                     The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!

                     'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to

                     It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though

                     I have for the most part been aired abroad, I

                     desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent

                     king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling

                     sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to

                     O, peace, Paulina!

                     Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As I by thine a wife: this is a match,

                     But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
