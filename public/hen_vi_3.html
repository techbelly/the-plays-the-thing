            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     I wonder how the king escaped our hands.                <br />

          <p>

                     While we pursued the horsemen of the north,                <br />
                     He slily stole away and left his men:                <br />
                     Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,                <br />
                     Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,                <br />
                     Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,                <br />
                     Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,                <br />
                     Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in                <br />
                     Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">EDWARD</b>
                     Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,                <br />
                     Is either slain or wounded dangerously;                <br />
                     I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:                <br />
                     That this is true, father, behold his blood.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MONTAGUE</b>
                     And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,                <br />
                     Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RICHARD</b>

                     Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.                <br />
                     But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">NORFOLK</b>
                     Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RICHARD</b>
                     Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,                <br />
                     Before I see thee seated in that throne                <br />
                     Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,                <br />
                     I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.                <br />
                     This is the palace of the fearful king,                <br />
                     And this the regal seat: possess it, York;                <br />
                     For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">YORK</b>
                     Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;                <br />
                     For hither we have broken in by force.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">NORFOLK</b>
                     We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">YORK</b>
                     Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;                <br />
                     And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     And when the king comes, offer no violence,                <br />
                     Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">YORK</b>
                     The queen this day here holds her parliament,                <br />
                     But little thinks we shall be of her council:                <br />
                     By words or blows here let us win our right.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RICHARD</b>
                     Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,                <br />
                     Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,                <br />
                     And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice                <br />
                     Hath made us by-words to our enemies.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">YORK</b>
                     Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;                <br />
                     I mean to take possession of my right.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,                <br />
                     The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,                <br />
                     Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.                <br />
                     I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:                <br />
                     Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,                <br />
                     Even in the chair of state: belike he means,                <br />
                     Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,                <br />
                     To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.                <br />
                     Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.                <br />
                     And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge                <br />
                     On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
                     If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CLIFFORD</b>
                     The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</b>
                     What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:                <br />
                     My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CLIFFORD</b>
                     Patience is for poltroons, such as he:                <br />
                     He durst not sit there, had your father lived.                <br />
                     My gracious lord, here in the parliament                <br />
                     Let us assail the family of York.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
                     Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     Ah, know you not the city favours them,                <br />
                     And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">EXETER</b>
                     But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,                <br />
                     To make a shambles of the parliament-house!                <br />
                     Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats                <br />
                     Shall be the war that Henry means to use.                <br />
                     Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,                <br />
                     and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;                <br />
                     I am thy sovereign.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">EXETER</b>
                     For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget                <br />
                     That we are those which chased you from the field                <br />
                     And slew your fathers, and with colours spread                <br />
                     March'd through the city to the palace gates.                <br />

                     Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.                <br />

                     I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger                <br />

                     Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;                <br />
                     Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:                <br />
                     I am the son of Henry the Fifth,                <br />
                     Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop                <br />

                     Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid                <br />
                     And never seen thee, never borne thee son,                <br />
                     Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father                <br />
                     Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?                <br />
                     Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,                <br />
                     Or felt that pain which I did for him once,                <br />

                     Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,                <br />
                     Rather than have that savage duke thine heir                <br />

                     I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!                <br />
                     Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;                <br />
                     And given unto the house of York such head                <br />
                     As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.                <br />
                     To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,                <br />
                     What is it, but to make thy sepulchre                <br />
                     And creep into it far before thy time?                <br />
                     Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;                <br />
                     Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;                <br />
                     The duke is made protector of the realm;                <br />
                     And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds                <br />
                     The trembling lamb environed with wolves.                <br />
                     Had I been there, which am a silly woman,                <br />
                     The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes                <br />
                     Before I would have granted to that act.                <br />
                     But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:                <br />
                     And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself                <br />
                     Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,                <br />
                     Until that act of parliament be repeal'd                <br />
                     Whereby my son is disinherited.                <br />
                     The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours                <br />
                     Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;                <br />
                     And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace                <br />
                     And utter ruin of the house of York.                <br />
                     Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;                <br />
                     Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.                <br />

                     Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.                <br />
                     Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think                <br />
                     How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;                <br />

                     And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;                <br />
                     And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,                <br />
                     And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice                <br />
                     Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!                <br />

                     I will not bandy with thee word for word,                <br />

                     Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes                <br />
                     I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.                <br />

                     Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much                <br />
                     To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:                <br />
                     What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,                <br />
                     For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,                <br />
                     When he might spurn him with his foot away?                <br />
                     It is war's prize to take all vantages;                <br />
                     And ten to one is no impeach of valour.                <br />

                     Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,                <br />
                     Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,                <br />
                     That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,                <br />
                     Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.                <br />
                     What! was it you that would be England's king?                <br />
                     Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,                <br />
                     And made a preachment of your high descent?                <br />
                     Where are your mess of sons to back you now?                <br />
                     The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?                <br />
                     And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,                <br />
                     Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice                <br />
                     Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?                <br />
                     Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?                <br />
                     Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood                <br />
                     That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,                <br />
                     Made issue from the bosom of the boy;                <br />
                     And if thine eyes can water for his death,                <br />
                     I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.                <br />
                     Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,                <br />
                     I should lament thy miserable state.                <br />
                     I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.                <br />
                     What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails                <br />
                     That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?                <br />
                     Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;                <br />
                     And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.                <br />
                     Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.                <br />
                     Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:                <br />
                     York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.                <br />
                     A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:                <br />
                     Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">Putting a paper crown on his head</i><br />
                     Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!                <br />
                     Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,                <br />
                     And this is he was his adopted heir.                <br />

                     Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?                <br />
                     As I bethink me, you should not be king                <br />
                     Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.                <br />
                     And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,                <br />
                     And rob his temples of the diadem,                <br />
                     Now in his life, against your holy oath?                <br />
                     O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!                <br />
                     Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;                <br />

                     I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.                <br />
                     To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,                <br />
                     Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.                <br />

                     Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.                <br />
                     Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?                <br />
                     It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,                <br />

            <b class="speaker">EDWARD</b>
                     I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,                <br />
                     Or whether he be 'scaped away or no                <br />
                     From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:                <br />
                     Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;                <br />
                     Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;                <br />
                     Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard                <br />
                     The happy tidings of his good escape.                <br />
                     How fares my brother? why is he so sad?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RICHARD</b>
                     I cannot joy, until I be resolved                <br />
                     Where our right valiant father is become.                <br />
                     I saw him in the battle range about;                <br />
                     And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.                <br />
                     Methought he bore him in the thickest troop                <br />
                     As doth a lion in a herd of neat;                <br />
                     Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,                <br />
                     Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,                <br />
                     The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.                <br />
                     So fared our father with his enemies;                <br />
                     So fled his enemies my warlike father:                <br />
                     Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.                <br />
                     See how the morning opes her golden gates,                <br />
                     And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!                <br />
                     How well resembles it the prime of youth,                <br />
                     Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!                <br />

            <b class="speaker">EDWARD</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RICHARD</b>
                     Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;                <br />
                     Not separated with the racking clouds,                <br />
                     But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.                <br />
                     See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,                <br />
                     As if they vow'd some league inviolable:                <br />
                     Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.                <br />
                     In this the heaven figures some event.                <br />

                     'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.                <br />
                     I think it cites us, brother, to the field,                <br />
                     That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,                <br />
                     Each one already blazing by our meeds,                <br />
                     Should notwithstanding join our lights together                <br />
                     And over-shine the earth as this the world.                <br />
                     Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear                <br />
                     Upon my target three fair-shining suns.                <br />

                     When as the noble Duke of York was slain,                <br />

                     Environed he was with many foes,                <br />
                     And stood against them, as the hope of Troy                <br />
                     Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.                <br />
                     But Hercules himself must yield to odds;                <br />
                     And many strokes, though with a little axe,                <br />
                     Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.                <br />
                     By many hands your father was subdued;                <br />
                     But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm                <br />
                     Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,                <br />
                     Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,                <br />
                     Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,                <br />
                     The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks                <br />
                     A napkin steeped in the harmless blood                <br />
                     Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:                <br />
                     And after many scorns, many foul taunts,                <br />
                     They took his head, and on the gates of York                <br />
                     They set the same; and there it doth remain,                <br />
                     The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.                <br />

                     Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,                <br />
                     Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.                <br />
                     O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain                <br />
                     The flower of Europe for his chivalry;                <br />
                     And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,                <br />
                     For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.                <br />
                     Now my soul's palace is become a prison:                <br />
                     Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body                <br />
                     Might in the ground be closed up in rest!                <br />
                     For never henceforth shall I joy again,                <br />
                     Never, O never shall I see more joy!                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">RICHARD</b>
                     I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture                <br />
                     Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:                <br />
                     Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;                <br />
                     For selfsame wind that I should speak withal                <br />
                     Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,                <br />
                     And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.                <br />
                     To weep is to make less the depth of grief:                <br />
                     Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me                <br />
                     Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,                <br />
                     Or die renowned by attempting it.                <br />

          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;                <br />
                     And now, to add more measure to your woes,                <br />
                     I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.                <br />
                     After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,                <br />
                     Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,                <br />
                     Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,                <br />
                     Were brought me of your loss and his depart.                <br />
                     I, then in London keeper of the king,                <br />
                     Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,                <br />
                     And very well appointed, as I thought,                <br />
                     March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,                <br />
                     Bearing the king in my behalf along;                <br />
                     For by my scouts I was advertised                <br />
                     That she was coming with a full intent                <br />
                     To dash our late decree in parliament                <br />
                     Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.                <br />
                     Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met                <br />
                     Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:                <br />
                     But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,                <br />
                     Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,                <br />
                     That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;                <br />
                     Or whether 'twas report of her success;                <br />
                     Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,                <br />
                     Who thunders to his captives blood and death,                <br />
                     I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,                <br />
                     Their weapons like to lightning came and went;                <br />
                     Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,                <br />
                     Or like an idle thresher with a flail,                <br />
                     Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.                <br />
                     I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,                <br />
                     With promise of high pay and great rewards:                <br />
                     But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,                <br />
                     And we in them no hope to win the day;                <br />

                     For in the marches here we heard you were,                <br />
                     Making another head to fight again.                <br />

                     Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?                <br />
                     And when came George from Burgundy to England?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;                <br />
                     And for your brother, he was lately sent                <br />
                     From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,                <br />
                     With aid of soldiers to this needful war.                <br />

                     Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,                <br />
                     But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.                <br />

                     Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,                <br />
                     And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,                <br />
                     Were he as famous and as bold in war                <br />

                     I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:                <br />
                     'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.                <br />
                     But in this troublous time what's to be done?                <br />
                     Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,                <br />
                     And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,                <br />
                     Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?                <br />
                     Or shall we on the helmets of our foes                <br />
                     Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?                <br />
                     If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;                <br />
                     And therefore comes my brother Montague.                <br />
                     Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,                <br />
                     With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,                <br />
                     And of their feather many more proud birds,                <br />
                     Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.                <br />
                     He swore consent to your succession,                <br />
                     His oath enrolled in the parliament;                <br />
                     And now to London all the crew are gone,                <br />
                     To frustrate both his oath and what beside                <br />
                     May make against the house of Lancaster.                <br />
                     Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:                <br />
                     Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,                <br />
                     With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,                <br />
                     Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,                <br />
                     Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,                <br />
                     Why, Via! to London will we march amain,                <br />
                     And once again bestride our foaming steeds,                <br />
                     And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'                <br />
                     But never once again turn back and fly.                <br />

                     Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:                <br />
                     Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,                <br />

                     Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.                <br />

                     My gracious liege, this too much lenity                <br />
                     And harmful pity must be laid aside.                <br />
                     To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?                <br />
                     Not to the beast that would usurp their den.                <br />
                     Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?                <br />
                     Not his that spoils her young before her face.                <br />
                     Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?                <br />
                     Not he that sets his foot upon her back.                <br />
                     The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,                <br />
                     And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.                <br />
                     Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,                <br />
                     Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:                <br />
                     He, but a duke, would have his son a king,                <br />
                     And raise his issue, like a loving sire;                <br />
                     Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,                <br />
                     Didst yield consent to disinherit him,                <br />
                     Which argued thee a most unloving father.                <br />
                     Unreasonable creatures feed their young;                <br />
                     And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,                <br />
                     Yet, in protection of their tender ones,                <br />
                     Who hath not seen them, even with those wings                <br />
                     Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,                <br />
                     Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,                <br />
                     Offer their own lives in their young's defence?                <br />
                     For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!                <br />
                     Were it not pity that this goodly boy                <br />
                     Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,                <br />
                     And long hereafter say unto his child,                <br />
                     'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got                <br />
                     My careless father fondly gave away'?                <br />
                     Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;                <br />
                     And let his manly face, which promiseth                <br />
                     Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart                <br />
                     To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.                <br />

                     And had he match'd according to his state,                <br />
                     He might have kept that glory to this day;                <br />
                     But when he took a beggar to his bed,                <br />
                     And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,                <br />

                     And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.                <br />
                     For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?                <br />
                     Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;                <br />

                     Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,                <br />
                     And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.                <br />

                     Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;                <br />
                     And in the very pangs of death he cried,                <br />

                     This battle fares like to the morning's war,                <br />
                     When dying clouds contend with growing light,                <br />
                     What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,                <br />
                     Can neither call it perfect day nor night.                <br />
                     Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea                <br />
                     Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;                <br />
                     Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea                <br />
                     Forced to retire by fury of the wind:                <br />
                     Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;                <br />
                     Now one the better, then another best;                <br />
                     Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,                <br />
                     Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:                <br />
                     So is the equal of this fell war.                <br />
                     Here on this molehill will I sit me down.                <br />
                     To whom God will, there be the victory!                <br />
                     For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,                <br />
                     Have chid me from the battle; swearing both                <br />
                     They prosper best of all when I am thence.                <br />
                     Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;                <br />
                     For what is in this world but grief and woe?                <br />
                     O God! methinks it were a happy life,                <br />
                     To be no better than a homely swain;                <br />
                     To sit upon a hill, as I do now,                <br />
                     To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,                <br />
                     Thereby to see the minutes how they run,                <br />
                     How many make the hour full complete;                <br />
                     How many hours bring about the day;                <br />
                     How many days will finish up the year;                <br />
                     How many years a mortal man may live.                <br />
                     When this is known, then to divide the times:                <br />
                     So many hours must I tend my flock;                <br />
                     So many hours must I take my rest;                <br />
                     So many hours must I contemplate;                <br />
                     So many hours must I sport myself;                <br />
                     So many days my ewes have been with young;                <br />
                     So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:                <br />
                     So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:                <br />
                     So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,                <br />
                     Pass'd over to the end they were created,                <br />
                     Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.                <br />
                     Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!                <br />
                     Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade                <br />
                     To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,                <br />
                     Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy                <br />
                     To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?                <br />
                     O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.                <br />
                     And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,                <br />
                     His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.                <br />

                     All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,                <br />
                     Is far beyond a prince's delicates,                <br />

                     His body couched in a curious bed,                <br />
                     When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.                <br />

                     Or as thy father and his father did,                <br />

                     I think his understanding is bereft.                <br />
                     Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?                <br />
                     Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,                <br />
                     And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.                <br />

                     O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:                <br />
                     'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,                <br />
                     Because he would avoid such bitter taunts                <br />
                     Which in the time of death he gave our father.                <br />

                     What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard                <br />
                     When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.                <br />
                     I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,                <br />
                     If this right hand would buy two hour's life,                <br />
                     That I in all despite might rail at him,                <br />
                     This hand should chop it off, and with the                <br />
                     issuing blood                <br />
                     Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst                <br />
                     York and young Rutland could not satisfy.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,                <br />
                     And rear it in the place your father's stands.                <br />
                     And now to London with triumphant march,                <br />
                     There to be crowned England's royal king:                <br />
                     From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,                <br />
                     And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:                <br />
                     So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;                <br />
                     And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread                <br />
                     The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;                <br />
                     For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,                <br />
                     Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.                <br />
                     First will I see the coronation;                <br />
                     And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,                <br />
                     To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.                <br />

                     Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;                <br />
                     For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,                <br />
                     And never will I undertake the thing                <br />
                     Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.                <br />
                     Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,                <br />
                     And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,                <br />
                     Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.                <br />

                     Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;                <br />
                     For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.                <br />

                     Tut, that's a foolish observation:                <br />
                     Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,                <br />
                     To see these honours in possession.                <br />

                     Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;                <br />
                     For through this laund anon the deer will come;                <br />
                     And in this covert will we make our stand,                <br />
                     Culling the principal of all the deer.                <br />

                     I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.                <br />

                     That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow                <br />
                     Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     My queen and son are gone to France for aid;                <br />
                     And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick                <br />
                     Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister                <br />
                     To wife for Edward: if this news be true,                <br />
                     Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;                <br />
                     For Warwick is a subtle orator,                <br />
                     And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.                <br />
                     By this account then Margaret may win him;                <br />
                     For she's a woman to be pitied much:                <br />
                     Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;                <br />
                     Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;                <br />
                     The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;                <br />
                     And Nero will be tainted with remorse,                <br />
                     To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.                <br />
                     Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;                <br />
                     She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,                <br />
                     He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.                <br />
                     She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;                <br />
                     He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;                <br />
                     That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;                <br />
                     Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,                <br />
                     Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,                <br />
                     And in conclusion wins the king from her,                <br />
                     With promise of his sister, and what else,                <br />
                     To strengthen and support King Edward's place.                <br />
                     O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,                <br />
                     Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Keeper</b>
                     Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     More than I seem, and less than I was born to:                <br />
                     A man at least, for less I should not be;                <br />
                     And men may talk of kings, and why not I?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Keeper</b>
                     Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Keeper</b>
                     But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     My crown is in my heart, not on my head;                <br />
                     Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,                <br />
                     Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:                <br />
                     A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Second Keeper</b>
                     Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,                <br />
                     Your crown content and you must be contented                <br />
                     To go along with us; for as we think,                <br />
                     You are the king King Edward hath deposed;                <br />
                     And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance                <br />
                     Will apprehend you as his enemy.                <br />

                     I was anointed king at nine months old;                <br />
                     My father and my grandfather were kings,                <br />
                     And you were sworn true subjects unto me:                <br />
                     And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Keeper</b>
                     No;                <br />
                     For we were subjects but while you were king.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?                <br />
                     Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!                <br />
                     Look, as I blow this feather from my face,                <br />
                     And as the air blows it to me again,                <br />
                     Obeying with my wind when I do blow,                <br />
                     And yielding to another when it blows,                <br />
                     Commanded always by the greater gust;                <br />
                     Such is the lightness of you common men.                <br />
                     But do not break your oaths; for of that sin                <br />
                     My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.                <br />
                     Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;                <br />
                     And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.                <br />

                     This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,                <br />
                     His lands then seized on by the conqueror:                <br />
                     Her suit is now to repossess those lands;                <br />
                     Which we in justice cannot well deny,                <br />
                     Because in quarrel of the house of York                <br />
                     The worthy gentleman did lose his life.                <br />

                     My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;                <br />

                     That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,                <br />
                     To cross me from the golden time I look for!                <br />
                     And yet, between my soul's desire and me--                <br />
                     The lustful Edward's title buried--                <br />

                     To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:                <br />
                     A cold premeditation for my purpose!                <br />
                     Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;                <br />
                     Like one that stands upon a promontory,                <br />
                     And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,                <br />
                     Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,                <br />
                     And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,                <br />
                     Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:                <br />
                     So do I wish the crown, being so far off;                <br />
                     And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;                <br />
                     And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,                <br />
                     Flattering me with impossibilities.                <br />
                     My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,                <br />
                     Unless my hand and strength could equal them.                <br />
                     Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;                <br />
                     What other pleasure can the world afford?                <br />
                     I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,                <br />
                     And deck my body in gay ornaments,                <br />
                     And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.                <br />
                     O miserable thought! and more unlikely                <br />
                     Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!                <br />
                     Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:                <br />
                     And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,                <br />
                     She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,                <br />
                     To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;                <br />
                     To make an envious mountain on my back,                <br />
                     Where sits deformity to mock my body;                <br />
                     To shape my legs of an unequal size;                <br />
                     To disproportion me in every part,                <br />
                     Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp                <br />
                     That carries no impression like the dam.                <br />
                     And am I then a man to be beloved?                <br />
                     O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!                <br />
                     Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,                <br />
                     But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such                <br />
                     As are of better person than myself,                <br />
                     I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,                <br />
                     And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,                <br />
                     Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head                <br />
                     Be round impaled with a glorious crown.                <br />
                     And yet I know not how to get the crown,                <br />
                     For many lives stand between me and home:                <br />
                     And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,                <br />
                     That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,                <br />
                     Seeking a way and straying from the way;                <br />
                     Not knowing how to find the open air,                <br />
                     But toiling desperately to find it out,--                <br />
                     Torment myself to catch the English crown:                <br />
                     And from that torment I will free myself,                <br />
                     Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.                <br />
                     Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,                <br />
                     And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,                <br />
                     And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,                <br />
                     And frame my face to all occasions.                <br />
                     I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;                <br />
                     I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;                <br />
                     I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,                <br />
                     Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,                <br />
                     And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.                <br />
                     I can add colours to the chameleon,                <br />
                     Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,                <br />
                     And set the murderous Machiavel to school.                <br />
                     Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?                <br />
                     Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.                <br />

                     No, mighty King of France: now Margaret                <br />
                     Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve                <br />
                     Where kings command. I was, I must confess,                <br />
                     Great Albion's queen in former golden days:                <br />
                     But now mischance hath trod my title down,                <br />
                     And with dishonour laid me on the ground;                <br />
                     Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,                <br />

                     Our people and our peers are both misled,                <br />

                     King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,                <br />
                     Before you answer Warwick. His demand                <br />
                     Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,                <br />
                     But from deceit bred by necessity;                <br />
                     For how can tyrants safely govern home,                <br />
                     Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?                <br />
                     To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,                <br />
                     That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,                <br />
                     Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.                <br />
                     Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage                <br />
                     Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;                <br />
                     For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,                <br />
                     Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Because thy father Henry did usurp;                <br />

                     Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,                <br />

                     And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,                <br />
                     Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;                <br />
                     And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,                <br />
                     Who by his prowess conquered all France:                <br />
                     From these our Henry lineally descends.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,                <br />
                     You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost                <br />
                     All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?                <br />
                     Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.                <br />
                     But for the rest, you tell a pedigree                <br />
                     Of threescore and two years; a silly time                <br />
                     To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.                <br />

          <p>

                     Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,                <br />
                     Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,                <br />
                     And not bewray thy treason with a blush?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,                <br />
                     Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?                <br />
                     For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">OXFORD</b>
                     Call him my king by whose injurious doom                <br />
                     My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,                <br />
                     Was done to death? and more than so, my father,                <br />
                     Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,                <br />
                     When nature brought him to the door of death?                <br />
                     No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,                <br />
                     This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.                <br />

                     While I use further conference with Warwick.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</b>
                     Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,                <br />
                     Is Edward your true king? for I were loath                <br />
                     To link with him that were not lawful chosen.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</b>

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>

            <b class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</b>

                     Tell me for truth the measure of his love                <br />
                     Unto our sister Bona.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Such it seems                <br />
                     As may beseem a monarch like himself.                <br />
                     Myself have often heard him say and swear                <br />
                     That this his love was an eternal plant,                <br />
                     Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,                <br />
                     The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,                <br />
                     Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,                <br />
                     Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</b>
                     Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BONA</b>
                     Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">To WARWICK</i><br />
                     Yet I confess that often ere this day,                <br />
                     When I have heard your king's desert recounted,                <br />
                     Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</b>
                     Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;                <br />
                     And now forthwith shall articles be drawn                <br />
                     Touching the jointure that your king must make,                <br />
                     Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.                <br />
                     Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness                <br />
                     That Bona shall be wife to the English king.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">QUEEN MARGARET</b>
                     Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device                <br />
                     By this alliance to make void my suit:                <br />
                     Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING LEWIS XI</b>
                     And still is friend to him and Margaret:                <br />
                     But if your title to the crown be weak,                <br />
                     As may appear by Edward's good success,                <br />
                     Then 'tis but reason that I be released                <br />
                     From giving aid which late I promised.                <br />
                     Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand                <br />
                     That your estate requires and mine can yield.                <br />

                     King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,                <br />
                     And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,                <br />
                     That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,                <br />
                     No more my king, for he dishonours me,                <br />
                     But most himself, if he could see his shame.                <br />
                     Did I forget that by the house of York                <br />
                     My father came untimely to his death?                <br />
                     Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?                <br />
                     Did I impale him with the regal crown?                <br />
                     Did I put Henry from his native right?                <br />
                     And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?                <br />
                     Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:                <br />
                     And to repair my honour lost for him,                <br />
                     I here renounce him and return to Henry.                <br />
                     My noble queen, let former grudges pass,                <br />
                     And henceforth I am thy true servitor:                <br />
                     I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,                <br />
                     And replant Henry in his former state.                <br />

                     Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,                <br />
                     But dreadful war shall answer his demand.                <br />
                     Had he none else to make a stale but me?                <br />
                     Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.                <br />
                     I was the chief that raised him to the crown,                <br />
                     And I'll be chief to bring him down again:                <br />

                     To raise my state to title of a queen,                <br />
                     Do me but right, and you must all confess                <br />
                     That I was not ignoble of descent;                <br />
                     And meaner than myself have had like fortune.                <br />
                     But as this title honours me and mine,                <br />
                     So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,                <br />
                     Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING EDWARD IV</b>
                     My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:                <br />
                     What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,                <br />
                     So long as Edward is thy constant friend,                <br />
                     And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?                <br />
                     Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,                <br />
                     Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;                <br />
                     Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,                <br />
                     And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.                <br />

                     'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,                <br />

                     I blame not her, she could say little less;                <br />
                     She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?                <br />

                     And turn'd my captive state to liberty,                <br />
                     My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,                <br />

                     I then crave pardon of your majesty.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     For what, lieutenant? for well using me?                <br />
                     Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,                <br />
                     For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;                <br />
                     Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds                <br />
                     Conceive when after many moody thoughts                <br />
                     At last by notes of household harmony                <br />
                     They quite forget their loss of liberty.                <br />
                     But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,                <br />
                     And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;                <br />
                     He was the author, thou the instrument.                <br />
                     Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite                <br />
                     By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,                <br />
                     And that the people of this blessed land                <br />
                     May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,                <br />
                     Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,                <br />
                     I here resign my government to thee,                <br />
                     For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">WARWICK</b>
                     Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;                <br />
                     And now may seem as wise as virtuous,                <br />
                     By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,                <br />

                     Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:                <br />
                     Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,                <br />

                     And in devotion spend my latter days,                <br />
                     To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.                <br />

                     We'll yoke together, like a double shadow                <br />
                     To Henry's body, and supply his place;                <br />

                     While he enjoys the honour and his ease.                <br />
                     And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful                <br />
                     Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,                <br />
                     And all his lands and goods be confiscate.                <br />

                     Should not be able to encounter mine.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">EXETER</b>
                     The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
                     That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:                <br />
                     I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,                <br />
                     Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;                <br />
                     My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,                <br />
                     My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,                <br />
                     My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;                <br />
                     I have not been desirous of their wealth,                <br />
                     Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.                <br />
                     Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:                <br />
                     Then why should they love Edward more than me?                <br />
                     No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:                <br />
                     And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,                <br />
                     The lamb will never cease to follow him.                <br />

                     Father of Warwick, know you what this means?                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">Taking his red rose out of his hat</i><br />
                     Look here, I throw my infamy at thee                <br />
                     I will not ruinate my father's house,                <br />
                     Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,                <br />
                     And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,                <br />
                     That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,                <br />
                     To bend the fatal instruments of war                <br />
                     Against his brother and his lawful king?                <br />
                     Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:                <br />
                     To keep that oath were more impiety                <br />
                     Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.                <br />
                     I am so sorry for my trespass made                <br />
                     That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,                <br />
                     I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,                <br />
                     With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--                <br />
                     As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--                <br />
                     To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.                <br />
                     And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,                <br />
                     And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.                <br />
                     Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:                <br />
                     And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,                <br />
                     For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.                <br />

                     And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I                <br />
                     For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?                <br />
                     We will not from the helm to sit and weep,                <br />
                     But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,                <br />
                     From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.                <br />
                     As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.                <br />
                     And what is Edward but ruthless sea?                <br />
                     What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?                <br />
                     And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?                <br />
                     All these the enemies to our poor bark.                <br />
                     Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!                <br />
                     Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:                <br />
                     Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,                <br />
                     Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.                <br />
                     This speak I, lords, to let you understand,                <br />
                     If case some one of you would fly from us,                <br />
                     That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers                <br />
                     More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.                <br />
                     Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided                <br />
                     'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.                <br />

                     O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!                <br />
                     Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!                <br />
                     They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,                <br />
                     Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,                <br />
                     If this foul deed were by to equal it:                <br />
                     He was a man; this, in respect, a child:                <br />
                     And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.                <br />
                     What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?                <br />
                     No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:                <br />
                     And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.                <br />
                     Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!                <br />
                     How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!                <br />
                     You have no children, butchers! if you had,                <br />
                     The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:                <br />
                     But if you ever chance to have a child,                <br />
                     Look in his youth to have him so cut off                <br />
                     As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!                <br />

                     The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;                <br />
                     Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;                <br />
                     The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,                <br />
                     And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.                <br />
                     Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,                <br />
                     And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,                <br />

                     I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.                <br />
                     Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;                <br />
                     For I have often heard my mother say                <br />
                     I came into the world with my legs forward:                <br />
                     Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,                <br />
                     And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?                <br />
                     The midwife wonder'd and the women cried                <br />
                     'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'                <br />
                     And so I was; which plainly signified                <br />
                     That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.                <br />
                     Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,                <br />
                     Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.                <br />
                     I have no brother, I am like no brother;                <br />
                     And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,                <br />

                     And not in me: I am myself alone.                <br />
                     Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:                <br />
                     But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;                <br />
                     For I will buz abroad such prophecies                <br />
                     That Edward shall be fearful of his life,                <br />
                     And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.                <br />
                     King Henry and the prince his son are gone:                <br />
                     Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,                <br />
                     Counting myself but bad till I be best.                <br />
                     I'll throw thy body in another room                <br />
                     And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.                <br />

                     Once more we sit in England's royal throne,                <br />
                     Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.                <br />
                     What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,                <br />
                     Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!                <br />
                     Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd                <br />
                     For hardy and undoubted champions;                <br />
                     Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,                <br />
                     And two Northumberlands; two braver men                <br />
                     Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;                <br />
                     With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,                <br />
                     That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion                <br />
                     And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.                <br />
                     Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat                <br />
                     And made our footstool of security.                <br />
                     Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.                <br />
                     Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself                <br />
                     Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,                <br />
                     Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,                <br />
                     That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;                <br />
                     And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.                <br />

                                       I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid;                <br />
                     For yet I am not look'd on in the world.                <br />
                     This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;                <br />
                     And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:                <br />
                     Work thou the way,--and thou shalt execute.                <br />

                                       To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master,                <br />
                     And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.                <br />

                     Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,                <br />

                     Away with her, and waft her hence to France.                <br />
                     And now what rests but that we spend the time                <br />
                     With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,                <br />
                     Such as befits the pleasure of the court?                <br />
                     Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!                <br />
                     For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.                <br />
