From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:

Where our right valiant father is become.

<span class="line" id="1-0-14">
I saw him in the battle range about;
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-15">
And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-0-16">
Methought he bore him in the thickest troop

<span class="line" id="1-0-17">
As doth a lion in a herd of neat;

Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-4">
Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-5">
What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-6">
Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-7">
Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-8">
For hardy and undoubted champions;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-9">
Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,

And two Northumberlands; two braver men
  <a class="line" href="#4-6-10">10</a>

<span class="line" id="4-6-11">
Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-12">
With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-13">
That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-14">
And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-15">
Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-16">
And made our footstool of security.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-17">
Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-6-18">
Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself

Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,

Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,

For yet I am not look'd on in the world.

To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master,

And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.

Reignier, her father, to the king of France

Away with her, and waft her hence to France.

And now what rests but that we spend the time

With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,

Such as befits the pleasure of the court?

Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!

For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.
