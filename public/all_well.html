      <h3>SCENE I.  Rousillon. The COUNT's palace. </h3>
          <p class="stagedir">Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,
and LAFEU, all in black</p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COUNTESS</b>
                     In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BERTRAM</b>
                     And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death                <br />
                     anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to                <br />
                     whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LAFEU</b>
                     You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,                <br />
                     sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times                <br />
                     good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose                <br />
                     worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather                <br />
                     than lack it where there is such abundance.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COUNTESS</b>
                     What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LAFEU</b>
                     He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose                <br />
                     practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and                <br />
                     finds no other advantage in the process but only the                <br />
                     losing of hope by time.                <br />

                     This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that                <br />
                     'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was                <br />
                     almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so                <br />
                     far, would have made nature immortal, and death                <br />
                     should have play for lack of work. Would, for the                <br />
                     king's sake, he were living! I think it would be                <br />
                     the death of the king's disease.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LAFEU</b>
                     How called you the man you speak of, madam?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COUNTESS</b>
                     He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was                <br />
                     his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LAFEU</b>
                     He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very                <br />
                     lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he                <br />
                     was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge                <br />
                     could be set up against mortality.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BERTRAM</b>
                     What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LAFEU</b>
                     A fistula, my lord.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BERTRAM</b>
                     I heard not of it before.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LAFEU</b>
                     I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman                <br />
                     the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COUNTESS</b>
                     His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my                <br />
                     overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that                <br />
                     her education promises; her dispositions she                <br />
                     inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where                <br />
                     an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there                <br />
                     commendations go with pity; they are virtues and                <br />
                     traitors too; in her they are the better for their                <br />
                     simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LAFEU</b>
                     Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COUNTESS</b>
                     'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise                <br />
                     in. The remembrance of her father never approaches                <br />
                     her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all                <br />
                     livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;                <br />
                     go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect                <br />
                     a sorrow than have it.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">HELENA</b>
                     I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LAFEU</b>
                     Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,                <br />
                     excessive grief the enemy to the living.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COUNTESS</b>
                     If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess                <br />
                     makes it soon mortal.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BERTRAM</b>
                     Madam, I desire your holy wishes.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LAFEU</b>
                     How understand we that?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">COUNTESS</b>
                     Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father                <br />
                     In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue                <br />

                     Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend                <br />
                     Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,                <br />
                     But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,                <br />
                     That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,                <br />
                     Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;                <br />

                     O, were that all! I think not on my father;                <br />
                     And these great tears grace his remembrance more                <br />
                     Than those I shed for him. What was he like?                <br />
                     I have forgot him: my imagination                <br />
                     Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.                <br />
                     I am undone: there is no living, none,                <br />
                     If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one                <br />

                     And think to wed it, he is so above me:                <br />
                     In his bright radiance and collateral light                <br />
                     Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.                <br />
                     The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:                <br />
                     The hind that would be mated by the lion                <br />
                     Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,                <br />
                     To see him every hour; to sit and draw                <br />
                     His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,                <br />

                     Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:                <br />
                     But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy                <br />
                     Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?                <br />

                     ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how                <br />

                     But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,                <br />
                     in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some                <br />

                     blowers up! Is there no military policy, how                <br />
                     virgins might blow up men?                <br />

                     Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be                <br />
                     blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with                <br />
                     the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It                <br />
                     is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to                <br />
                     preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational                <br />
                     increase and there was never virgin got till                <br />
                     virginity was first lost. That you were made of is                <br />
                     metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost                <br />
                     may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is                <br />
                     ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">HELENA</b>
                     I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PAROLLES</b>
                     There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the                <br />
                     rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,                <br />
                     is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible                <br />
                     disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:                <br />
                     virginity murders itself and should be buried in                <br />
                     highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate                <br />
                     offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,                <br />
                     much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very                <br />
                     paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.                <br />
                     Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of                <br />
                     self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the                <br />
                     canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose                <br />
                     by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make                <br />
                     itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the                <br />
                     principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!                <br />

                     How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?                <br />

                     Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it                <br />
                     likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with                <br />
                     lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't                <br />
                     while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.                <br />
                     Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out                <br />
                     of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just                <br />
                     like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not                <br />
                     now. Your date is better in your pie and your                <br />
                     porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,                <br />
                     your old virginity, is like one of our French                <br />
                     withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,                <br />
                     'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;                <br />
                     marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?                <br />

                     His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world                <br />
                     Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,                <br />

                     It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,                <br />
                     Young Bertram.                <br />

                     Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;                <br />
                     Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,                <br />
                     Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts                <br />
                     Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.                <br />

                     I would I had that corporal soundness now,                <br />
                     As when thy father and myself in friendship                <br />
                     First tried our soldiership! He did look far                <br />
                     Into the service of the time and was                <br />
                     Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;                <br />
                     But on us both did haggish age steal on                <br />
                     And wore us out of act. It much repairs me                <br />
                     To talk of your good father. In his youth                <br />
                     He had the wit which I can well observe                <br />
                     To-day in our young lords; but they may jest                <br />
                     Till their own scorn return to them unnoted                <br />
                     Ere they can hide their levity in honour;                <br />
                     So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness                <br />
                     Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,                <br />
                     His equal had awaked them, and his honour,                <br />
                     Clock to itself, knew the true minute when                <br />
                     Exception bid him speak, and at this time                <br />
                     His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him                <br />
                     He used as creatures of another place                <br />
                     And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,                <br />
                     Making them proud of his humility,                <br />
                     In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man                <br />
                     Might be a copy to these younger times;                <br />
                     Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now                <br />
                     But goers backward.                <br />

                     His good remembrance, sir,                <br />
                     Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;                <br />
                     So in approof lives not his epitaph                <br />
                     As in your royal speech.                <br />

                     Would I were with him! He would always say--                <br />
                     Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words                <br />
                     He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,                <br />
                     To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--                <br />
                     This his good melancholy oft began,                <br />
                     On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,                <br />
                     When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,                <br />
                     'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff                <br />
                     Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses                <br />
                     All but new things disdain; whose judgments are                <br />
                     Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies                <br />
                     Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;                <br />
                     I after him do after him wish too,                <br />
                     Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,                <br />
                     I quickly were dissolved from my hive,                <br />
                     To give some labourers room.                <br />

                     Since the physician at your father's died?                <br />
                     He was much famed.                <br />

                     Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out                <br />
                     With several applications; nature and sickness                <br />
                     Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;                <br />

                     You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the                <br />
                     knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.                <br />
                     He that ears my land spares my team and gives me                <br />
                     leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my                <br />
                     drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher                <br />
                     of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh                <br />
                     and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my                <br />
                     flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses                <br />
                     my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to                <br />
                     be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;                <br />

                     religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl                <br />

                     Madam, I was very late more near her than I think                <br />
                     she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate                <br />
                     to herself her own words to her own ears; she                <br />

                     stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:                <br />
                     Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put                <br />
                     such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no                <br />
                     god, that would not extend his might, only where                <br />
                     qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that                <br />
                     would suffer her poor knight surprised, without                <br />
                     rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.                <br />
                     This she delivered in the most bitter touch of                <br />
                     sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I                <br />
                     held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;                <br />

                     My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:                <br />
                     Be not offended; for it hurts not him                <br />
                     That he is loved of me: I follow him not                <br />
                     By any token of presumptuous suit;                <br />
                     Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;                <br />
                     Yet never know how that desert should be.                <br />
                     I know I love in vain, strive against hope;                <br />
                     Yet in this captious and intenible sieve                <br />
                     I still pour in the waters of my love                <br />
                     And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,                <br />
                     Religious in mine error, I adore                <br />
                     The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,                <br />
                     But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,                <br />
                     Let not your hate encounter with my love                <br />
                     For loving where you do: but if yourself,                <br />
                     Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,                <br />
                     Did ever in so true a flame of liking                <br />
                     Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian                <br />
                     Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity                <br />
                     To her, whose state is such that cannot choose                <br />
                     But lend and give where she is sure to lose;                <br />
                     That seeks not to find that her search implies,                <br />
                     But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!                <br />

                     For that is her demand, and know her business?                <br />

                     Ay, my good lord.                <br />
                     Gerard de Narbon was my father;                <br />
                     In what he did profess, well found.                <br />

                     The rather will I spare my praises towards him:                <br />
                     Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death                <br />
                     Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.                <br />
                     Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,                <br />
                     And of his old experience the oily darling,                <br />
                     He bade me store up, as a triple eye,                <br />
                     Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;                <br />

                     From her inaidible estate; I say we must not                <br />
                     So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,                <br />
                     To prostitute our past-cure malady                <br />
                     To empirics, or to dissever so                <br />

                     Oft does them by the weakest minister:                <br />
                     So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,                <br />
                     When judges have been babes; great floods have flown                <br />
                     From simple sources, and great seas have dried                <br />
                     When miracles have by the greatest been denied.                <br />
                     Oft expectation fails and most oft there                <br />
                     Where most it promises, and oft it hits                <br />
                     Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.                <br />

                     She had her breeding at my father's charge.                <br />
                     A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain                <br />
                     Rather corrupt me ever!                <br />

                     'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which                <br />
                     I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,                <br />
                     Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,                <br />
                     Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off                <br />
                     In differences so mighty. If she be                <br />
                     All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,                <br />
                     A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest                <br />
                     Of virtue for the name: but do not so:                <br />
                     From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,                <br />
                     The place is dignified by the doer's deed:                <br />
                     Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,                <br />
                     It is a dropsied honour. Good alone                <br />
                     Is good without a name. Vileness is so:                <br />
                     The property by what it is should go,                <br />
                     Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;                <br />
                     In these to nature she's immediate heir,                <br />
                     And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,                <br />
                     Which challenges itself as honour's born                <br />
                     And is not like the sire: honours thrive,                <br />
                     When rather from our acts we them derive                <br />
                     Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave                <br />
                     Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave                <br />
                     A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb                <br />
                     Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb                <br />
                     Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?                <br />
                     If thou canst like this creature as a maid,                <br />
                     I can create the rest: virtue and she                <br />
                     Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.                <br />

                     My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,                <br />
                     I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,                <br />
                     Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;                <br />
                     That dost in vile misprision shackle up                <br />
                     My love and her desert; that canst not dream,                <br />
                     We, poising us in her defective scale,                <br />
                     Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,                <br />
                     It is in us to plant thine honour where                <br />
                     We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:                <br />
                     Obey our will, which travails in thy good:                <br />
                     Believe not thy disdain, but presently                <br />
                     Do thine own fortunes that obedient right                <br />
                     Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;                <br />
                     Or I will throw thee from my care for ever                <br />
                     Into the staggers and the careless lapse                <br />
                     Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate                <br />
                     Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,                <br />
                     Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.                <br />

                     My fancy to your eyes: when I consider                <br />

                     garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of                <br />

                     every man should beat thee: I think thou wast                <br />

                     The reasons of our state I cannot yield,                <br />
                     But like a common and an outward man,                <br />
                     That the great figure of a council frames                <br />
                     By self-unable motion: therefore dare not                <br />
                     Say what I think of it, since I have found                <br />
                     Myself in my incertain grounds to fail                <br />
                     As often as I guess'd.                <br />

                     Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;                <br />
                     Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I                <br />
                     That chase thee from thy country and expose                <br />
                     Those tender limbs of thine to the event                <br />
                     Of the none-sparing war? and is it I                <br />
                     That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou                <br />
                     Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark                <br />
                     Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,                <br />
                     That ride upon the violent speed of fire,                <br />
                     Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,                <br />
                     That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.                <br />
                     Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;                <br />
                     Whoever charges on his forward breast,                <br />
                     I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;                <br />
                     And, though I kill him not, I am the cause                <br />
                     His death was so effected: better 'twere                <br />
                     I met the ravin lion when he roar'd                <br />
                     With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere                <br />
                     That all the miseries which nature owes                <br />
                     Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,                <br />
                     Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,                <br />
                     As oft it loses all: I will be gone;                <br />
                     My being here it is that holds thee hence:                <br />
                     Shall I stay here to do't?  no, no, although                <br />
                     The air of paradise did fan the house                <br />
                     And angels officed all: I will be gone,                <br />
                     That pitiful rumour may report my flight,                <br />
                     To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!                <br />
                     For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.                <br />

                     Hark you! they come this way.                <br />
                     If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,                <br />
                     But till the troops come by,                <br />
                     I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;                <br />
                     The rather, for I think I know your hostess                <br />
                     As ample as myself.                <br />

                     As 'tis reported, for the king had married him                <br />

                     In argument of praise, or to the worth                <br />
                     Of the great count himself, she is too mean                <br />
                     To have her name repeated: all her deserving                <br />
                     Is a reserved honesty, and that                <br />

                     How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your                <br />

                     A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PAROLLES</b>
                     'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!                <br />
                     There was excellent command,--to charge in with our                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">First Lord</b>
                     That was not to be blamed in the command of the                <br />
                     service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar                <br />
                     himself could not have prevented, if he had been                <br />

                     Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some                <br />
                     dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is                <br />
                     not to be recovered.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PAROLLES</b>
                     It might have been recovered.                <br />

                     It is to be recovered: but that the merit of                <br />
                     service is seldom attributed to the true and exact                <br />

                     speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to                <br />

                     Titled goddess;                <br />
                     And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,                <br />
                     In your fine frame hath love no quality?                <br />
                     If quick fire of youth light not your mind,                <br />
                     You are no maiden, but a monument:                <br />
                     When you are dead, you should be such a one                <br />
                     As you are now, for you are cold and stem;                <br />
                     And now you should be as your mother was                <br />
                     When your sweet self was got.                <br />

                     'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,                <br />
                     But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.                <br />
                     What is not holy, that we swear not by,                <br />
                     But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,                <br />
                     If I should swear by God's great attributes,                <br />
                     I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,                <br />
                     When I did love you ill? This has no holding,                <br />
                     To swear by him whom I protest to love,                <br />
                     That I will work against him: therefore your oaths                <br />
                     Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,                <br />
                     At least in my opinion.                <br />

                     Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his                <br />
                     house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques                <br />
                     le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere                <br />
                     sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the                <br />
                     tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her                <br />
                     grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and                <br />
                     now she sings in heaven.                <br />

                     letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to                <br />
                     you, when I have held familiarity with fresher                <br />
                     clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's                <br />
                     mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong                <br />
                     displeasure.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Clown</b>
                     Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it                <br />
                     smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will                <br />
                     henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.                <br />
                     Prithee, allow the wind.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">PAROLLES</b>
                     Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake                <br />
                     but by a metaphor.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">Clown</b>
                     Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my                <br />
                     nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get                <br />

                     close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he                <br />

                     cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the                <br />
                     unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he                <br />

                     Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour                <br />

                     Ask him upon his oath, if he does think                <br />
                     He had not my virginity.                <br />

                     He might have bought me at a common price:                <br />
                     Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,                <br />
                     Whose high respect and rich validity                <br />
                     Did lack a parallel; yet for all that                <br />
                     He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,                <br />

                     He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BERTRAM</b>
                     I think she has: certain it is I liked her,                <br />
                     And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:                <br />
                     She knew her distance and did angle for me,                <br />
                     Madding my eagerness with her restraint,                <br />
                     As all impediments in fancy's course                <br />
                     Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,                <br />
                     Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,                <br />
                     Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;                <br />
                     And I had that which any inferior might                <br />
                     At market-price have bought.                <br />

                     May justly diet me. I pray you yet;                <br />
                     Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;                <br />

                     as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for                <br />

                     was in that credit with them at that time that I                <br />
                     knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,                <br />
                     as promising her marriage, and things which would                <br />
                     derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not                <br />

                     Take her away; I do not like her now;                <br />
                     To prison with her: and away with him.                <br />

                     Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:                <br />
                     He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;                <br />
                     I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.                <br />
                     Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;                <br />
                     I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.                <br />

                     Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:                <br />
               <i class="stagedir">Exit Widow</i><br />
                     The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,                <br />
                     And he shall surety me. But for this lord,                <br />
                     Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,                <br />
                     Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:                <br />
                     He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;                <br />
                     And at that time he got his wife with child:                <br />
                     Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:                <br />
                     So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:                <br />
                     And now behold the meaning.                <br />

                     O my good lord, when I was like this maid,                <br />
                     I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;                <br />
                     And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:                <br />
                     'When from my finger you can get this ring                <br />
                     And are by me with child,' &amp;c. This is done:                <br />
                     Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?                <br />

                     If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,                <br />
                     I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.                <br />
