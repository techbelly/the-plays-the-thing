Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow

This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,

Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;

Know of your youth, examine well your blood,

You can endure the livery of a nun,

Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,

I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:

Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
