<h3>SCENE I.  A desert place. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
When shall we three meet again
<br />
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Witch</b>
When the hurlyburly's done,
<br />
When the battle's lost and won.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Witch</b>
That will be ere the set of sun.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
Where the place?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Witch</b>
Upon the heath.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Witch</b>
There to meet with Macbeth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
I come, Graymalkin!

Paddock calls.

<h3>SCENE II.  A camp near Forres. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN,
LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUNCAN</b>
What bloody man is that? He can report,
<br />
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
<br />
The newest state.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
This is the sergeant
<br />
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
<br />
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
<br />
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
<br />
As thou didst leave it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Sergeant</b>
Doubtful it stood;
<br />
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
<br />
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
<br />
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
<br />
The multiplying villanies of nature
<br />
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
<br />
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
<br />
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
<br />
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
<br />
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
<br />
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
<br />
Which smoked with bloody execution,
<br />
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
<br />
Till he faced the slave;
<br />
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
<br />
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
<br />
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUNCAN</b>
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Sergeant</b>
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
<br />
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
<br />
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
<br />
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
<br />
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
<br />
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
<br />
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
<br />
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
<br />
Began a fresh assault.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUNCAN</b>
Dismay'd not this
<br />
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Sergeant</b>
Yes;
<br />
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
<br />
If I say sooth, I must report they were
<br />
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
<br />
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
<br />
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
<br />
Or memorise another Golgotha,
<br />
I cannot tell.
<br />
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUNCAN</b>
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
<br />
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exit Sergeant, attended</i><br />
Who comes here?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter ROSS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
The worthy thane of Ross.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LENNOX</b>
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
<br />
That seems to speak things strange.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
God save the king!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUNCAN</b>
Whence camest thou, worthy thane?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
From Fife, great king;
<br />
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
<br />
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
<br />
With terrible numbers,
<br />
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
<br />
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
<br />
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
<br />
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
<br />
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
<br />
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
<br />
The victory fell on us.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUNCAN</b>
Great happiness!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
That now
<br />
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
<br />
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
<br />
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
<br />
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUNCAN</b>
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
<br />
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
<br />
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
I'll see it done.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUNCAN</b>
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

<h3>SCENE III.  A heath near Forres. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Thunder. Enter the three Witches</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
Where hast thou been, sister?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Witch</b>
Killing swine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Witch</b>
Sister, where thou?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
<br />
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
<br />
'Give me,' quoth I:
<br />
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
<br />
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
<br />
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
<br />
And, like a rat without a tail,
<br />
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Witch</b>
I'll give thee a wind.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
Thou'rt kind.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Witch</b>
And I another.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
I myself have all the other,
<br />
And the very ports they blow,
<br />
All the quarters that they know
<br />
I' the shipman's card.
<br />
I will drain him dry as hay:
<br />
Sleep shall neither night nor day
<br />
Hang upon his pent-house lid;
<br />
He shall live a man forbid:
<br />
Weary se'nnights nine times nine
<br />
Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
<br />
Though his bark cannot be lost,
<br />
Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
<br />
Look what I have.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Witch</b>
Show me, show me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
Here I have a pilot's thumb,
<br />
Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Drum within</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Witch</b>
A drum, a drum!
<br />
Macbeth doth come.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ALL</b>
The weird sisters, hand in hand,
<br />
Posters of the sea and land,
<br />
Thus do go about, about:
<br />
Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
<br />
And thrice again, to make up nine.
<br />
Peace! the charm's wound up.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter MACBETH and BANQUO</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
<br />
So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
<br />
That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
<br />
And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
<br />
That man may question? You seem to understand me,
<br />
By each at once her chappy finger laying
<br />
Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
<br />
And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
<br />
That you are so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Speak, if you can: what are you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Witch</b>
All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Witch</b>
All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
<br />
Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
<br />
Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
<br />
Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
<br />
You greet with present grace and great prediction
<br />
Of noble having and of royal hope,
<br />
That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
<br />
If you can look into the seeds of time,
<br />
And say which grain will grow and which will not,
<br />
Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
<br />
Your favours nor your hate.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
Hail!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Witch</b>
Hail!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Witch</b>
Hail!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Witch</b>
Not so happy, yet much happier.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Third Witch</b>
Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
<br />
So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Witch</b>
Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
<br />
By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
<br />
But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
<br />
A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
<br />
Stands not within the prospect of belief,
<br />
No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
<br />
You owe this strange intelligence? or why
<br />
Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
<br />
With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Witches vanish</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
<br />
And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
<br />
As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
Were such things here as we do speak about?
<br />
Or have we eaten on the insane root
<br />
That takes the reason prisoner?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Your children shall be kings.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
You shall be king.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter ROSS and ANGUS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
<br />
The news of thy success; and when he reads
<br />
Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
<br />
His wonders and his praises do contend
<br />
Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
<br />
In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
<br />
He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
<br />
Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
<br />
Strange images of death. As thick as hail
<br />
Came post with post; and every one did bear
<br />
Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
<br />
And pour'd them down before him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGUS</b>
We are sent
<br />
To give thee from our royal master thanks;
<br />
Only to herald thee into his sight,
<br />
Not pay thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
<br />
He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
<br />
In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
<br />
For it is thine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
What, can the devil speak true?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
<br />
In borrow'd robes?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGUS</b>
Who was the thane lives yet;
<br />
But under heavy judgment bears that life
<br />
Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
<br />
With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
<br />
With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
<br />
He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
<br />
But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
<br />
Have overthrown him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
<br />
The greatest is behind.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To ROSS and ANGUS</i><br />
Thanks for your pains.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">To BANQUO</i><br />
Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
<br />
When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
<br />
Promised no less to them?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
That trusted home
<br />
Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
<br />
Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
<br />
And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
<br />
The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
<br />
Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
<br />
In deepest consequence.
<br />
Cousins, a word, I pray you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
Two truths are told,
<br />
As happy prologues to the swelling act
<br />
Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
<br />
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
This supernatural soliciting
<br />
Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
<br />
Why hath it given me earnest of success,
<br />
Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
<br />
If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
<br />
Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
<br />
And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
<br />
Against the use of nature? Present fears
<br />
Are less than horrible imaginings:
<br />
My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
<br />
Shakes so my single state of man that function
<br />
Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
<br />
But what is not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
Look, how our partner's rapt.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
<br />
Without my stir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
New horrors come upon him,
<br />
Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
<br />
But with the aid of use.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
<i class="parenthetical">Aside</i>
Come what come may,
<br />
Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
<br />
With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
<br />
Are register'd where every day I turn
<br />
The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
<br />
Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
<br />
The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
<br />
Our free hearts each to other.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BANQUO</b>
Very gladly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Till then, enough. Come, friends.

My liege,

They are not yet come back. But I have spoke

With one that saw him die: who did report
<br />
That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
<br />
Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
<br />
A deep repentance: nothing in his life
<br />
Became him like the leaving it; he died

As one that had been studied in his death
<br />
To throw away the dearest thing he owed,

As 'twere a careless trifle.

There's no art

To find the mind's construction in the face:

He was a gentleman on whom I built

An absolute trust.

<i class="stagedir">Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS</i><br />
O worthiest cousin!
<br />
The sin of my ingratitude even now
<br />
Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
<br />
That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
<br />
To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
<br />
That the proportion both of thanks and payment
<br />
Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
<br />
More is thy due than more than all can pay.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
The service and the loyalty I owe,
<br />
In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
<br />
Is to receive our duties; and our duties
<br />
Are to your throne and state children and servants,
<br />
Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
<br />
Safe toward your love and honour.

<b class="speaker">DUNCAN</b>
Welcome hither:
<br />
I have begun to plant thee, and will labour

To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,

That hast no less deserved, nor must be known

No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
<br />
And hold thee to my heart.

The harvest is your own.

My plenteous joys,

Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves

In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,

And you whose places are the nearest, know
<br />
We will establish our estate upon

Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter

On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,

For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;

<h3>SCENE V.  Inverness. Macbeth's castle. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
'They met me in the day of success: and I have
<br />
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
<br />
them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
<br />
to question them further, they made themselves air,
<br />
into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
<br />
the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
<br />
all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
<br />
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
<br />
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
<br />
shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
<br />
thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
<br />
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
<br />
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
<br />
to thy heart, and farewell.'
<br />
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
<br />
What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
<br />
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
<br />
To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
<br />
Art not without ambition, but without
<br />
The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
<br />
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,

That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
<br />
And that which rather thou dost fear to do

Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
<br />
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
<br />
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
<br />
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
<br />
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
<br />
To have thee crown'd withal.

So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:

One of my fellows had the speed of him,

Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more

The raven himself is hoarse

Under my battlements. Come, you spirits

That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
<br />
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full

Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
<br />
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
<br />
That no compunctious visitings of nature
<br />
Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between

The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
<br />
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
<br />
Wherever in your sightless substances
<br />
You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
<br />
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,

The future in the instant.

To-morrow, as he purposes.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
O, never

Shall sun that morrow see!
<br />
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
<br />
May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
<br />
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
<br />
Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
<br />
But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
<br />
Must be provided for: and you shall put
<br />
This night's great business into my dispatch;
<br />
Which shall to all our nights and days to come

Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

This guest of summer,

Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
<br />
Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird

And thank us for your trouble.

All our service

We rest your hermits.

Where's the thane of Cawdor?

We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose

To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,

We are your guest to-night.

<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Your servants ever

If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well

With his surcease success; that but this blow

Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
<br />
But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
<br />
We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
<br />
We still have judgment here; that we but teach
<br />
Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
<br />
To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
<br />
Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
<br />
To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
<br />
First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
<br />
Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
<br />
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
<br />
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
<br />
Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
<br />
So clear in his great office, that his virtues

Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against

The deep damnation of his taking-off;

And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
<br />
Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed

Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
<br />
Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,

That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur

Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself

We will proceed no further in this business:
<br />
He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
<br />
Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
<br />
Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
<br />
Not cast aside so soon.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Was the hope drunk
<br />
Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
<br />
And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
<br />
At what it did so freely? From this time
<br />
Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
<br />
To be the same in thine own act and valour
<br />
As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
<br />
Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
<br />
And live a coward in thine own esteem,

Like the poor cat i' the adage?

I dare do all that may become a man;

Who dares do more is none.

<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
What beast was't, then,
<br />
That made you break this enterprise to me?
<br />
When you durst do it, then you were a man;
<br />
And, to be more than what you were, you would
<br />
Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
<br />
Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
<br />
They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
<br />
Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
<br />
How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
<br />
I would, while it was smiling in my face,
<br />
Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
<br />
And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
<br />
Have done to this.

And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--

Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
<br />
Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
<br />
Will I with wine and wassail so convince
<br />
That memory, the warder of the brain,
<br />
Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
<br />
A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
<br />
Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
<br />
What cannot you and I perform upon
<br />
The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
<br />
His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
<br />
Of our great quell?

<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Bring forth men-children only;

For thy undaunted mettle should compose

Nothing but males. Will it not be received,

Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
<br />
That they have done't?

What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:

He hath been in unusual pleasure, and

Sent forth great largess to your offices.

This diamond he greets your wife withal,

By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up

In measureless content.

At your kind'st leisure.

Is this a dagger which I see before me,

The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.

I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.

Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
<br />
To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
<br />
A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
<br />
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
<br />
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
<br />
As this which now I draw.
<br />
Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
<br />
And such an instrument I was to use.
<br />
Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
<br />
Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
<br />
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
<br />
Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
<br />
It is the bloody business which informs
<br />
Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
<br />
Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
<br />
The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
<br />
Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
<br />
Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
<br />
Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
<br />
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
<br />
Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
<br />
Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
<br />
Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
<br />
And take the present horror from the time,
<br />
Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:

Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.

One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;

As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.

Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'

When they did say 'God bless us!'

Consider it not so deeply.

</p>
<p>

I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
<br />
Stuck in my throat.

These deeds must not be thought
<br />
After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
<br />

Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
<br />
Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
<br />
Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
<br />
The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
<br />
Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
<br />
Chief nourisher in life's feast,--
<br />

What do you mean?

'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor

Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
<br />
You do unbend your noble strength, to think
<br />
So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
<br />
And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
<br />
Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
<br />
They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
<br />
The sleepy grooms with blood.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
I'll go no more:
<br />
I am afraid to think what I have done;
<br />
Look on't again I dare not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Infirm of purpose!
<br />
Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
<br />
Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood

That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
<br />
I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;

For it must seem their guilt.

'Faith sir, we were carousing till the

second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
<br />
provoker of three things.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
What three things does drink especially provoke?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Porter</b>
Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
<br />
urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
<br />
it provokes the desire, but it takes
<br />
away the performance: therefore, much drink
<br />
may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
<br />
it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
<br />
him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
<br />
and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
<br />
not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
<br />
in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.

I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

That it did, sir, i' the very throat on

me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I

up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast

And prophesying with accents terrible

Of dire combustion and confused events

New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird

His silver skin laced with his golden blood;

Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers

Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,

Threescore and ten I can remember well:

Within the volume of which time I have seen

Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
<br />
Hath trifled former knowings.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
Ah, good father,
<br />
Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
<br />
Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
<br />
And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
<br />
Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
<br />
That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
<br />
When living light should kiss it?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Old Man</b>
'Tis unnatural,
<br />
Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
<br />
A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
<br />
Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.

<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--

Alas, the day!

<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
They were suborn'd:

To be thus is nothing;

But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo

Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature

Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
<br />
And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
<br />
He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
<br />
To act in safety. There is none but he
<br />
Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
<br />
My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
<br />
Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
<br />
When first they put the name of king upon me,
<br />
And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
<br />
They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
<br />
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
<br />
And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
<br />
Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
<br />
No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
<br />
For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
<br />
For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
<br />
Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
<br />
Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
<br />
Given to the common enemy of man,

According to the gift which bounteous nature

<br />
And I will put that business in your bosoms,
<br />
Whose execution takes your enemy off,
<br />
Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
<br />
Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
<br />
Which in his death were perfect.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
I am one, my liege,
<br />
Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
<br />
Have so incensed that I am reckless what
<br />
I do to spite the world.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
And I another
<br />
So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
<br />
That I would set my lie on any chance,
<br />
To mend it, or be rid on't.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Both of you
<br />
Know Banquo was your enemy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Both Murderers</b>
True, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
<br />
That every minute of his being thrusts
<br />
Against my near'st of life: and though I could
<br />
With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
<br />
And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
<br />
For certain friends that are both his and mine,
<br />
Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
<br />
Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
<br />
That I to your assistance do make love,
<br />
Masking the business from the common eye
<br />
For sundry weighty reasons.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Murderer</b>
We shall, my lord,
<br />
Perform what you command us.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Murderer</b>
Though our lives--
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
<br />
I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
<br />
Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
<br />
The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
<br />
And something from the palace; always thought
<br />
That I require a clearness: and with him--
<br />
To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
<br />
Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
<br />
Whose absence is no less material to me
<br />
Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
<br />
Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
<br />
I'll come to you anon.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Both Murderers</b>
We are resolved, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exeunt Murderers</i><br />
It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,

If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.

<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Is Banquo gone from court?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Servant</b>
Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Say to the king, I would attend his leisure

For a few words.

Madam, I will.

</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>

Nought's had, all's spent,
<br />
Where our desire is got without content:
<br />
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
<br />
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter MACBETH</i><br />
How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
<br />
Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
<br />
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
<br />
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
<br />
Should be without regard: what's done is done.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
<br />
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
<br />
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
<br />
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
<br />
worlds suffer,
<br />
Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
<br />
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
<br />
That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
<br />
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
<br />
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
<br />
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
<br />
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
<br />
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
<br />
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
<br />
Can touch him further.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Come on;
<br />
Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
<br />
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
<br />
Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
<br />
Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
<br />
Unsafe the while, that we
<br />
Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
<br />
And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
<br />
Disguising what they are.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
You must leave this.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
<br />
Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
<br />
Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
<br />
His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
<br />
The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
<br />
Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
<br />
A deed of dreadful note.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
What's to be done?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACBETH</b>
Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
<br />
Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
<br />
Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
<br />
And with thy bloody and invisible hand
<br />
Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
<br />
Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
<br />
Makes wing to the rooky wood:
<br />
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
<br />
While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
<br />
Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
<br />
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
<br />
So, prithee, go with me.

Most royal sir,

Fleance is 'scaped.

Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,

Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,

That, when the brains were out, the man would die,

<p class="stagedir">Enter LENNOX and another Lord</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LENNOX</b>
My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
<br />
Which can interpret further: only, I say,
<br />
Things have been strangely borne. The
<br />
gracious Duncan
<br />
Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
<br />
And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
<br />
Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
<br />
For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
<br />
Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
<br />
It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
<br />
To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
<br />
How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
<br />
In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
<br />
That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
<br />
Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
<br />
For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
<br />
To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
<br />
He has borne all things well: and I do think
<br />
That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
<br />
As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
<br />
should find
<br />
What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
<br />
But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
<br />
His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
<br />
Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
<br />
Where he bestows himself?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord</b>
The son of Duncan,
<br />
From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
<br />
Lives in the English court, and is received
<br />
Of the most pious Edward with such grace
<br />
That the malevolence of fortune nothing
<br />
Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
<br />
Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
<br />
To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
<br />
That, by the help of these--with Him above
<br />
To ratify the work--we may again
<br />
Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
<br />
Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
<br />
Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
<br />
All which we pine for now: and this report
<br />
Hath so exasperate the king that he
<br />
Prepares for some attempt of war.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LENNOX</b>
Sent he to Macduff?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord</b>
He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
<br />
The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
<br />
And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
<br />
That clogs me with this answer.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LENNOX</b>
And that well might
<br />
Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
<br />
His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
<br />
Fly to the court of England and unfold
<br />
His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
<br />
May soon return to this our suffering country
<br />
Under a hand accursed!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Lord</b>
I'll send my prayers with him.

Eye of newt and toe of frog,

Wool of bat and tongue of dog,

Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,

Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,

Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,

His mansion and his titles in a place

From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;

He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,

The most diminutive of birds, will fight,

But cruel are the times, when we are traitors

And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour

Each way and move. I take my leave of you:

Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
<br />
Weep our sad bosoms empty.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
Let us rather
<br />
Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
<br />
Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
<br />
New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
<br />
Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
<br />
As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
<br />
Like syllable of dolour.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
What I believe I'll wail,
<br />
What know believe, and what I can redress,
<br />
As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
<br />
What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
<br />
This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
<br />
Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
<br />
He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
<br />
but something
<br />
You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
<br />
To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
<br />
To appease an angry god.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
I am not treacherous.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
But Macbeth is.
<br />
A good and virtuous nature may recoil
<br />
In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
<br />
your pardon;
<br />
That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
<br />
Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
<br />
Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
<br />
Yet grace must still look so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
I have lost my hopes.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
<br />
Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
<br />
Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
<br />
Without leave-taking? I pray you,
<br />
Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
<br />
But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
<br />
Whatever I shall think.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
Bleed, bleed, poor country!
<br />
Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
<br />
For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
<br />
thy wrongs;
<br />
The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
<br />
I would not be the villain that thou think'st
<br />
For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
<br />
And the rich East to boot.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
Be not offended:
<br />
I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
<br />
I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
<br />
It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
<br />
Is added to her wounds: I think withal
<br />
There would be hands uplifted in my right;
<br />
And here from gracious England have I offer
<br />
Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
<br />
When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
<br />
Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
<br />
Shall have more vices than it had before,
<br />
More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
<br />
By him that shall succeed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
What should he be?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
It is myself I mean: in whom I know
<br />
All the particulars of vice so grafted
<br />
That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
<br />
Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
<br />
Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
<br />
With my confineless harms.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
Not in the legions
<br />
Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
<br />
In evils to top Macbeth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
I grant him bloody,
<br />
Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
<br />
Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
<br />
That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
<br />
In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
<br />
Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
<br />
The cistern of my lust, and my desire
<br />
All continent impediments would o'erbear
<br />
That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
<br />
Than such an one to reign.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
Boundless intemperance
<br />
In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
<br />
The untimely emptying of the happy throne
<br />
And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
<br />
To take upon you what is yours: you may
<br />
Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
<br />
And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
<br />
We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
<br />
That vulture in you, to devour so many
<br />
As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
<br />
Finding it so inclined.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
With this there grows
<br />
In my most ill-composed affection such
<br />
A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
<br />
I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
<br />
Desire his jewels and this other's house:
<br />
And my more-having would be as a sauce
<br />
To make me hunger more; that I should forge
<br />
Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
<br />
Destroying them for wealth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
This avarice
<br />
Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
<br />
Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
<br />
The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
<br />
Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
<br />
Of your mere own: all these are portable,
<br />
With other graces weigh'd.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
<br />
As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
<br />
Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
<br />
Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
<br />
I have no relish of them, but abound
<br />
In the division of each several crime,
<br />
Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
<br />
Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
<br />
Uproar the universal peace, confound
<br />
All unity on earth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
O Scotland, Scotland!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
<br />
I am as I have spoken.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
Fit to govern!
<br />
No, not to live. O nation miserable,
<br />
With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
<br />
When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
<br />
Since that the truest issue of thy throne
<br />
By his own interdiction stands accursed,
<br />
And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
<br />
Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
<br />
Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
<br />
Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
<br />
These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
<br />
Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
<br />
Thy hope ends here!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
Macduff, this noble passion,
<br />
Child of integrity, hath from my soul
<br />
Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
<br />
To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
<br />
By many of these trains hath sought to win me
<br />
Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
<br />
From over-credulous haste: but God above
<br />
Deal between thee and me! for even now
<br />
I put myself to thy direction, and
<br />
Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
<br />
The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
<br />
For strangers to my nature. I am yet
<br />
Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
<br />
Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
<br />
At no time broke my faith, would not betray
<br />
The devil to his fellow and delight
<br />
No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
<br />
Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
<br />
Is thine and my poor country's to command:
<br />
Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
<br />
Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
<br />
Already at a point, was setting forth.
<br />
Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
<br />
Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
<br />
'Tis hard to reconcile.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter a Doctor</p>

Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?

Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
<br />
That stay his cure: their malady convinces

The great assay of art; but at his touch--
<br />
Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
<br />
They presently amend.

<p>

What's the disease he means?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
'Tis call'd the evil:
<br />
A most miraculous work in this good king;
<br />
Which often, since my here-remain in England,
<br />
I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
<br />
Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
<br />
All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
<br />
The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
<br />
Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
<br />
Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
<br />
To the succeeding royalty he leaves
<br />
The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
<br />
He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
<br />
And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
<br />
That speak him full of grace.

<p class="stagedir">Enter ROSS</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
See, who comes here?

My countryman; but yet I know him not.

<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
Stands Scotland where it did?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
Alas, poor country!
<br />
Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
<br />
Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
<br />
But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
<br />
Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
<br />
Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
<br />
A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
<br />
Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
<br />
Expire before the flowers in their caps,
<br />
Dying or ere they sicken.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
O, relation
<br />
Too nice, and yet too true!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
What's the newest grief?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
<br />
Each minute teems a new one.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
How does my wife?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
Why, well.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
And all my children?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
Well too.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
When I came hither to transport the tidings,
<br />
Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
<br />
Of many worthy fellows that were out;
<br />
Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
<br />
For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
<br />
Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
<br />
Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
<br />
To doff their dire distresses.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
Be't their comfort
<br />
We are coming thither: gracious England hath
<br />
Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
<br />
An older and a better soldier none
<br />
That Christendom gives out.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
Would I could answer
<br />
This comfort with the like! But I have words
<br />
That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
<br />
Where hearing should not latch them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
What concern they?
<br />
The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
<br />
Due to some single breast?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
No mind that's honest
<br />
But in it shares some woe; though the main part
<br />
Pertains to you alone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
If it be mine,
<br />
Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
<br />
Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
<br />
That ever yet they heard.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
Hum! I guess at it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
<br />
Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
<br />
Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
<br />
To add the death of you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
Merciful heaven!
<br />
What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
<br />
Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
<br />
Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
My children too?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
Wife, children, servants, all
<br />
That could be found.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
And I must be from thence!
<br />
My wife kill'd too?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ROSS</b>
I have said.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
Be comforted:
<br />
Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
<br />
To cure this deadly grief.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
He has no children. All my pretty ones?
<br />
Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
<br />
What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
<br />
At one fell swoop?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
Dispute it like a man.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
I shall do so;
<br />
But I must also feel it as a man:
<br />
I cannot but remember such things were,
<br />
That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
<br />
And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
<br />
They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
<br />
Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
<br />
Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
<br />
Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MACDUFF</b>
O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
<br />
And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
<br />
Cut short all intermission; front to front
<br />
Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
<br />
Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
<br />
Heaven forgive him too!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">MALCOLM</b>
This tune goes manly.
<br />
Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
<br />
Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
<br />
Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
<br />
Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
<br />
The night is long that never finds the day.

I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive

no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentlewoman</b>
Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
<br />
her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
<br />
her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
<br />
write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
<br />
return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
<br />
the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
<br />
watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
<br />
walking and other actual performances, what, at any
<br />
time, have you heard her say?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentlewoman</b>
That, sir, which I will not report after her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentlewoman</b>
Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
<br />
confirm my speech.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper</i><br />
Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
<br />
and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
How came she by that light?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentlewoman</b>
Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
<br />
continually; 'tis her command.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
You see, her eyes are open.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentlewoman</b>
Ay, but their sense is shut.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentlewoman</b>
It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
<br />
washing her hands: I have known her continue in
<br />
this a quarter of an hour.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Yet here's a spot.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
<br />
her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
<br />
then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
<br />
lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
<br />
fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
<br />
account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
<br />
to have had so much blood in him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
Do you mark that?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
<br />
What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
<br />
that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
<br />
this starting.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentlewoman</b>
She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
<br />
that: heaven knows what she has known.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
<br />
perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
<br />
hand. Oh, oh, oh!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentlewoman</b>
I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the

dignity of the whole body.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
Well, well, well,--

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gentlewoman</b>
Pray God it be, sir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
<br />
those which have walked in their sleep who have died
<br />
holily in their beds.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LADY MACBETH</b>
Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
<br />
pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he

cannot come out on's grave.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
Even so?
<br />

To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:

done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!

Directly.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Doctor</b>
Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
<br />
Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
<br />
To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
<br />
More needs she the divine than the physician.
<br />
God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
<br />
Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
<br />
And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:

My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.

For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file

Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:

Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
<br />
Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
<br />
He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
<br />
Within the belt of rule.

Now does he feel
<br />
His secret murders sticking on his hands;

Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
<br />
Those he commands move only in command,
<br />
Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
<br />
Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
<br />
Upon a dwarfish thief.

<b class="speaker">MENTEITH</b>
Who then shall blame

His pester'd senses to recoil and start,

Itself for being there?

Well, march we on,
<br />
To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:

Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,

And with him pour we in our country's purge

Each drop of us.
