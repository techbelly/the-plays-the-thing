He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,

Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,

A most delicious banquet by his bed,

Would not the beggar then forget himself?

Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Huntsman</b>

It would seem strange unto him when he waked.

Carry him gently to my fairest chamber

<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters

And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:

Procure me music ready when he wakes,

To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;

Say 'What is it your honour will command?'

Some one be ready with a costly suit

And ask him what apparel he will wear;

<span class="line" id="0-0-80">
Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-80">80</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-81">
And that his lady mourns at his disease:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-82">
Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-83">
And when he says he is, say that he dreams,

<span class="line" id="0-0-84">
For he is nothing but a mighty lord.

<span class="line" id="0-0-85">
This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-86">
It will be pastime passing excellent,
