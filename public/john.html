                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For new-made honour doth forget men's names;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     'Tis too respective and too sociable
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For your conversion. Now your traveller,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Why then I suck my teeth and catechise
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And then comes answer like an Absey book:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     At your employment; at your service, sir;'
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And so, ere answer knows what question would,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Saving in dialogue of compliment,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The Pyrenean and the river Po,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But this is worshipful society
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And fits the mounting spirit like myself,

                     For he is but a bastard to the time
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That doth not smack of observation;

                     And so am I, whether I smack or no;

                     But from the inward motion to deliver
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:

                     Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.

                     But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?

                     Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:

                     Sir Robert might have eat his part in me

                     Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,

                     Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:

                     We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,

                     King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:

                     Both are alike; and both alike we like.

                     Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,

                     And give you entrance: but without this match,

                     If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know

                     Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,

                     But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.

                     I had a thing to say, but let it go:

                     The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,

                     Is all too wanton and too full of gawds

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Sound on into the drowsy race of night;

                     If this same were a churchyard where we stand,

                     Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes

                     A passion hateful to my purposes,

                     Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;

                     And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.

                     Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:

                     Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,

                     The best I had, a princess wrought it me,

                     And I did never ask it you again;

                     And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;

                     But you at your sick service had a prince.

                     Some reasons of this double coronation

                     I have possess'd you with and think them strong;

                     I shall indue you with: meantime but ask

                     What you would have reform'd that is not well,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And well shall you perceive how willingly

                     This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.

                     I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.

                     I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:
