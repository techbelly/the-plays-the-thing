The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.

<span class="line" id="0-0-136">
The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-137">
Retiring from the siege of Orleans,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-138">
Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-139">
By three and twenty thousand of the French
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-140">
Was round encompassed and set upon.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-140">140</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-141">
No leisure had he to enrank his men;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-142">
He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-143">
Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-144">
They pitched in the ground confusedly,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-145">
To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-146">
More than three hours the fight continued;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-147">
Where valiant Talbot above human thought
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-148">
Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-149">
Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-150">
Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-150">150</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-151">
The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-152">
All the whole army stood agazed on him:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-153">
His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-154">
A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-155">
And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.

<span class="line" id="0-0-156">
Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,

<h3>SCENE V.  London. The palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI,
GLOUCESTER and EXETER</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-3">
Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-4">
Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-5">
Her virtues graced with external gifts
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-6">
Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-7">
And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-8">
Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-9">
So am I driven by breath of her renown
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-10">
Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
  <a class="line" href="#4-4-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-11">
Where I may have fruition of her love.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-13">
Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-14">
Is but a preface of her worthy praise;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-15">
The chief perfections of that lovely dame
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-16">
Had I sufficient skill to utter them,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-17">
Would make a volume of enticing lines,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-18">
Able to ravish any dull conceit:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-19">
And, which is more, she is not so divine,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-20">
So full-replete with choice of all delights,
  <a class="line" href="#4-4-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-21">
But with as humble lowliness of mind
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-22">
She is content to be at your command;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-23">
Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-24">
To love and honour Henry as her lord.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">KING HENRY VI</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-26">
And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-27">
Therefore, my lord protector, give consent
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-28">
That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-30">
So should I give consent to flatter sin.
  <a class="line" href="#4-4-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-31">
You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-32">
Unto another lady of esteem:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-33">
How shall we then dispense with that contract,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-34">
And not deface your honour with reproach?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-36">
As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-37">
Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-38">
To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-39">
By reason of his adversary's odds:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-40">
A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
  <a class="line" href="#4-4-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-41">
And therefore may be broke without offence.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-43">
Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-44">
Her father is no better than an earl,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-45">
Although in glorious titles he excel.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-47">
Yes, lord, her father is a king,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-48">
The King of Naples and Jerusalem;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-49">
And of such great authority in France
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-50">
As his alliance will confirm our peace
  <a class="line" href="#4-4-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-51">
And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">GLOUCESTER</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-53">
And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-54">
Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">EXETER</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-56">
Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-57">
Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">SUFFOLK</b>
<span class="line" id="4-4-59">
A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-60">
That he should be so abject, base and poor,
  <a class="line" href="#4-4-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-61">
To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-62">
Henry is able to enrich his queen
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-63">
And not seek a queen to make him rich:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-64">
So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-65">
As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-66">
Marriage is a matter of more worth
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-67">
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-68">
Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-69">
Must be companion of his nuptial bed:
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-70">
And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
  <a class="line" href="#4-4-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-71">
It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-72">
In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-73">
For what is wedlock forced but a hell,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-74">
An age of discord and continual strife?
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-75">
Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-76">
And is a pattern of celestial peace.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-77">
Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-78">
But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-79">
Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-80">
Approves her fit for none but for a king:
  <a class="line" href="#4-4-80">80</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-81">
Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-82">
More than in women commonly is seen,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-83">
Will answer our hope in issue of a king;
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-84">
For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-85">
Is likely to beget more conquerors,
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-86">
If with a lady of so high resolve
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-87">
As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-88">
Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
</span>
<span class="line" id="4-4-89">
That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.

I cannot tell; but this I am assured,
