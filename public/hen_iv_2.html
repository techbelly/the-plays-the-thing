                     What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now                <br />
                     Should be the father of some stratagem:                <br />
                     The times are wild: contention, like a horse                <br />
                     Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose                <br />
                     And bears down all before him.                <br />

                     Noble earl,                <br />
                     I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>

            <b class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</b>
                     As good as heart can wish:                <br />
                     The king is almost wounded to the death;                <br />
                     And, in the fortune of my lord your son,                <br />
                     Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts                <br />
                     Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John                <br />
                     And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;                <br />
                     And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,                <br />
                     Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,                <br />
                     So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,                <br />
                     Came not till now to dignify the times,                <br />
                     Since Caesar's fortunes!                <br />

                     How is this derived?                <br />
                     Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</b>
                     I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,                <br />
                     A gentleman well bred and of good name,                <br />
                     That freely render'd me these news for true.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
                     Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent                <br />
                     On Tuesday last to listen after news.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</b>
                     My lord, I over-rode him on the way;                <br />
                     And he is furnish'd with no certainties                <br />
                     More than he haply may retail from me.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
                     Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">TRAVERS</b>
                     My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back                <br />
                     With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,                <br />
                     Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard                <br />
                     A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,                <br />
                     That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.                <br />
                     He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him                <br />
                     I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:                <br />
                     He told me that rebellion had bad luck                <br />
                     And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.                <br />
                     With that, he gave his able horse the head,                <br />
                     And bending forward struck his armed heels                <br />
                     Against the panting sides of his poor jade                <br />
                     Up to the rowel-head, and starting so                <br />
                     He seem'd in running to devour the way,                <br />
                     Staying no longer question.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
                     Ha! Again:                <br />
                     Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?                <br />
                     Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion                <br />
                     Had met ill luck?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LORD BARDOLPH</b>
                     My lord, I'll tell you what;                <br />
                     If my young lord your son have not the day,                <br />
                     Upon mine honour, for a silken point                <br />
                     I'll give my barony: never talk of it.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
                     Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers                <br />
                     Give then such instances of loss?                <br />

                     He was some hilding fellow that had stolen                <br />
                     The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,                <br />
                     Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.                <br />

                     Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,                <br />
                     Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:                <br />
                     So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood                <br />
                     Hath left a witness'd usurpation.                <br />
                     Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MORTON</b>
                     I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;                <br />
                     Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask                <br />
                     To fright our party.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
                     How doth my son and brother?                <br />
                     Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek                <br />
                     Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.                <br />
                     Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,                <br />
                     So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,                <br />
                     Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,                <br />
                     And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;                <br />
                     But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,                <br />
                     And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.                <br />
                     This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;                <br />
                     Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'                <br />
                     Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:                <br />
                     But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,                <br />
                     Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,                <br />
                     Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MORTON</b>
                     Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;                <br />
                     But, for my lord your son--                <br />

                     Why, he is dead.                <br />
                     See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!                <br />
                     He that but fears the thing he would not know                <br />
                     Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes                <br />
                     That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;                <br />
                     Tell thou an earl his divination lies,                <br />
                     And I will take it as a sweet disgrace                <br />
                     And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MORTON</b>
                     You are too great to be by me gainsaid:                <br />
                     Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">NORTHUMBERLAND</b>
                     Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.                <br />
                     I see a strange confession in thine eye:                <br />
                     Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin                <br />
                     To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;                <br />
                     The tongue offends not that reports his death:                <br />
                     And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,                <br />
                     Not he which says the dead is not alive.                <br />
                     Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news                <br />
                     Hath but a losing office, and his tongue                <br />
                     Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,                <br />
                     Remember'd tolling a departing friend.                <br />

                     That which I would to God I had not seen;                <br />
                     But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,                <br />
                     Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,                <br />
                     To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down                <br />
                     The never-daunted Percy to the earth,                <br />
                     From whence with life he never more sprung up.                <br />
                     In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire                <br />
                     Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,                <br />
                     Being bruited once, took fire and heat away                <br />
                     From the best temper'd courage in his troops;                <br />
                     For from his metal was his party steel'd;                <br />
                     Which once in him abated, all the rest                <br />
                     Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:                <br />
                     And as the thing that's heavy in itself,                <br />
                     Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,                <br />
                     So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,                <br />
                     Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear                <br />
                     That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim                <br />
                     Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,                <br />
                     Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester                <br />
                     Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,                <br />
                     The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword                <br />
                     Had three times slain the appearance of the king,                <br />
                     'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame                <br />
                     Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,                <br />
                     Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all                <br />
                     Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out                <br />
                     A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,                <br />
                     Under the conduct of young Lancaster                <br />
                     And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.                <br />

                     For this I shall have time enough to mourn.                <br />
                     In poison there is physic; and these news,                <br />
                     Having been well, that would have made me sick,                <br />
                     Being sick, have in some measure made me well:                <br />
                     And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,                <br />
                     Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,                <br />
                     Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire                <br />
                     Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,                <br />
                     Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,                <br />
                     Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!                <br />
                     A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel                <br />
                     Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!                <br />
                     Thou art a guard too wanton for the head                <br />
                     Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.                <br />
                     Now bind my brows with iron; and approach                <br />
                     The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring                <br />
                     To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!                <br />
                     Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand                <br />
                     Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!                <br />
                     And let this world no longer be a stage                <br />
                     To feed contention in a lingering act;                <br />
                     But let one spirit of the first-born Cain                <br />
                     Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set                <br />
                     On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,                <br />

                     You cast the event of war, my noble lord,                <br />
                     And summ'd the account of chance, before you said                <br />
                     'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,                <br />
                     That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:                <br />
                     You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,                <br />
                     More likely to fall in than to get o'er;                <br />
                     You were advised his flesh was capable                <br />
                     Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit                <br />
                     Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:                <br />
                     Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,                <br />
                     Though strongly apprehended, could restrain                <br />

                     I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,                <br />
                     The gentle Archbishop of York is up                <br />

                     Who with a double surety binds his followers.                <br />
                     My lord your son had only but the corpse,                <br />
                     But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;                <br />
                     For that same word, rebellion, did divide                <br />
                     The action of their bodies from their souls;                <br />
                     And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,                <br />
                     As men drink potions, that their weapons only                <br />
                     Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,                <br />
                     This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,                <br />
                     As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop                <br />
                     Turns insurrection to religion:                <br />
                     Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,                <br />
                     He's followed both with body and with mind;                <br />
                     And doth enlarge his rising with the blood                <br />
                     Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;                <br />
                     Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;                <br />

                     see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.                <br />
                     Where's Bardolph?                <br />

                     He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in                <br />
                     Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the                <br />
                     stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.                <br />

                     Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the                <br />

                     What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not                <br />
                     wars? is there not employment? doth not the king                <br />
                     lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?                <br />
                     Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it                <br />
                     is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,                <br />
                     were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell                <br />
                     how to make it.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting                <br />
                     my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied                <br />
                     in my throat, if I had said so.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Servant</b>
                     I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our                <br />
                     soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,                <br />
                     you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other                <br />

            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     My good lord! God give your lordship good time of                <br />
                     day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard                <br />
                     say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship                <br />
                     goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not                <br />
                     clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in                <br />
                     you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must                <br />
                     humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care                <br />
                     of your health.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to                <br />
                     Shrewsbury.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is                <br />
                     returned with some discomfort from Wales.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when                <br />
                     I sent for you.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into                <br />
                     this same whoreson apoplexy.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with                <br />
                     you.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,                <br />
                     an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the                <br />
                     blood, a whoreson tingling.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     What tell you me of it? be it as it is.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     It hath its original from much grief, from study and                <br />
                     perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of                <br />
                     his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     I think you are fallen into the disease; for you                <br />
                     hear not what I say to you.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please                <br />
                     you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady                <br />
                     of not marking, that I am troubled withal.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     To punish you by the heels would amend the                <br />
                     attention of your ears; and I care not if I do                <br />
                     become your physician.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:                <br />
                     your lordship may minister the potion of                <br />
                     imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how                <br />
                     should I be your patient to follow your                <br />
                     prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a                <br />
                     scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     I sent for you, when there were matters against you                <br />
                     for your life, to come speak with me.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the                <br />
                     laws of this land-service, I did not come.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     I would it were otherwise; I would my means were                <br />
                     greater, and my waist slenderer.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     You have misled the youthful prince.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow                <br />
                     with the great belly, and he my dog.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your                <br />
                     day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded                <br />
                     over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may                <br />
                     thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting                <br />
                     that action.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     My lord?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a                <br />
                     sleeping wolf.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt                <br />
                     out.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say                <br />
                     of wax, my growth would approve the truth.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     There is not a white hair on your face but should                <br />
                     have his effect of gravity.                <br />

                     You follow the young prince up and down, like his                <br />
                     ill angel.                <br />

                     Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope                <br />
                     he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:                <br />
                     and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I                <br />
                     cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these                <br />
                     costermonger times that true valour is turned                <br />
                     bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath                <br />
                     his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the                <br />
                     other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of                <br />
                     this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.                <br />
                     You that are old consider not the capacities of us                <br />
                     that are young; you do measure the heat of our                <br />
                     livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we                <br />
                     that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,                <br />
                     are wags too.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,                <br />
                     that are written down old with all the characters of                <br />
                     age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a                <br />
                     yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an                <br />
                     increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your                <br />
                     wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and                <br />
                     every part about you blasted with antiquity? and                <br />
                     will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!                <br />

                     My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the                <br />
                     afternoon, with a white head and something a round                <br />
                     belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing                <br />
                     and singing of anthems. To approve my youth                <br />
                     further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in                <br />
                     judgment and understanding; and he that will caper                <br />
                     with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the                <br />
                     money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that                <br />
                     the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,                <br />
                     and you took it like a sensible lord. I have                <br />
                     chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;                <br />
                     marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk                <br />
                     and old sack.                <br />

                     you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,                <br />
                     that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the                <br />
                     Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean                <br />
                     not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,                <br />
                     and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I                <br />
                     might never spit white again. There is not a                <br />
                     dangerous action can peep out his head but I am                <br />
                     thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it                <br />
                     was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if                <br />
                     they have a good thing, to make it too common. If                <br />
                     ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give                <br />

                     terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be                <br />
                     eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to                <br />

                     And our supplies live largely in the hope                <br />
                     Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns                <br />

                     We first survey the plot, then draw the model;                <br />
                     And when we see the figure of the house,                <br />
                     Then must we rate the cost of the erection;                <br />
                     Which if we find outweighs ability,                <br />
                     What do we then but draw anew the model                <br />
                     In fewer offices, or at last desist                <br />
                     To build at all? Much more, in this great work,                <br />
                     Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down                <br />
                     And set another up, should we survey                <br />
                     The plot of situation and the model,                <br />
                     Consent upon a sure foundation,                <br />
                     Question surveyors, know our own estate,                <br />
                     How able such a work to undergo,                <br />
                     To weigh against his opposite; or else                <br />
                     We fortify in paper and in figures,                <br />
                     Using the names of men instead of men:                <br />
                     Like one that draws the model of a house                <br />
                     Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,                <br />
                     Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost                <br />
                     A naked subject to the weeping clouds                <br />
                     And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.                <br />

                     And publish the occasion of our arms.                <br />
                     The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;                <br />
                     Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:                <br />
                     An habitation giddy and unsure                <br />
                     Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.                <br />
                     O thou fond many, with what loud applause                <br />
                     Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,                <br />
                     Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!                <br />
                     And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,                <br />
                     Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,                <br />
                     That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.                <br />
                     So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge                <br />
                     Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;                <br />
                     And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,                <br />
                     And howl'st to find it. What trust is in                <br />
                     these times?                <br />
                     They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,                <br />
                     Are now become enamour'd on his grave:                <br />
                     Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head                <br />
                     When through proud London he came sighing on                <br />
                     After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,                <br />
                     Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,                <br />
                     And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!                <br />

                     O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I am                <br />
                     a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MISTRESS QUICKLY</b>
                     It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,                <br />
                     all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;                <br />
                     he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of                <br />

                     at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon                <br />
                     Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke                <br />

                     Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me                <br />

                     whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I                <br />
                     told thee they were ill for a green wound? And                <br />
                     didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,                <br />
                     desire me to be no more so familiarity with such                <br />

                     me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me                <br />
                     fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy                <br />

                     Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your                <br />
                     manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It                <br />
                     is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words                <br />
                     that come with such more than impudent sauciness                <br />
                     from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:                <br />
                     you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the                <br />
                     easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her                <br />
                     serve your uses both in purse and in person.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">MISTRESS QUICKLY</b>

                     unpay the villany you have done her: the one you                <br />
                     may do with sterling money, and the other with                <br />

                     reply. You call honourable boldness impudent                <br />
                     sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say                <br />
                     nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble                <br />
                     duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say                <br />
                     to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,                <br />

                     Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.                <br />

                     My lord!                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     What's the matter?                <br />

            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">GOWER</b>
                     I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,                <br />
                     good Sir John.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to                <br />
                     take soldiers up in counties as you go.                <br />

          <p>

                     Will you sup with me, Master Gower?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FALSTAFF</b>
                     Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool                <br />
                     that taught them me. This is the right fencing                <br />
                     grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.                <br />

          <p class="stagedir">Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS</p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     Before God, I am exceeding weary.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POINS</b>
                     Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not                <br />
                     have attached one of so high blood.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     Faith, it does me; though it discolours the                <br />
                     complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth                <br />
                     it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POINS</b>
                     Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as                <br />
                     to remember so weak a composition.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,                <br />
                     by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,                <br />
                     small beer. But, indeed, these humble                <br />
                     considerations make me out of love with my                <br />
                     greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember                <br />
                     thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to                <br />
                     take note how many pair of silk stockings thou                <br />
                     hast, viz. these, and those that were thy                <br />
                     peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy                <br />
                     shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for                <br />
                     use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better                <br />
                     than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when                <br />
                     thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done                <br />
                     a great while, because the rest of thy low                <br />
                     countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:                <br />
                     and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins                <br />
                     of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the                <br />
                     midwives say the children are not in the fault;                <br />
                     whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are                <br />
                     mightily strengthened.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POINS</b>
                     How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,                <br />
                     you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good                <br />
                     young princes would do so, their fathers being so                <br />
                     sick as yours at this time is?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POINS</b>
                     Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POINS</b>
                     Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you                <br />
                     will tell.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be                <br />
                     sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell                <br />
                     thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a                <br />
                     better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad                <br />
                     indeed too.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POINS</b>
                     Very hardly upon such a subject.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's                <br />
                     book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and                <br />
                     persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell                <br />
                     thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so                <br />
                     sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art                <br />
                     hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POINS</b>
                     The reason?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POINS</b>
                     I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     It would be every man's thought; and thou art a                <br />
                     blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never                <br />
                     a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way                <br />
                     better than thine: every man would think me an                <br />
                     hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most                <br />
                     worshipful thought to think so?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">POINS</b>
                     Why, because you have been so lewd and so much                <br />
                     engraffed to Falstaff.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">PRINCE HENRY</b>
                     And to thee.                <br />

                     By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it                <br />
                     with my own ears: the worst that they can say of                <br />
                     me is that I am a second brother and that I am a                <br />
                     proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I                <br />
                     confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.                <br />

                     O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!                <br />
                     The time was, father, that you broke your word,                <br />
                     When you were more endeared to it than now;                <br />
                     When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,                <br />
                     Threw many a northward look to see his father                <br />
                     Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.                <br />
                     Who then persuaded you to stay at home?                <br />
                     There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.                <br />
                     For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!                <br />
                     For his, it stuck upon him as the sun                <br />
                     In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light                <br />
                     Did all the chivalry of England move                <br />
                     To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass                <br />
                     Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:                <br />
                     He had no legs that practised not his gait;                <br />
                     And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,                <br />
                     Became the accents of the valiant;                <br />
                     For those that could speak low and tardily                <br />
                     Would turn their own perfection to abuse,                <br />
                     To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,                <br />
                     In diet, in affections of delight,                <br />
                     In military rules, humours of blood,                <br />
                     He was the mark and glass, copy and book,                <br />
                     That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!                <br />
                     O miracle of men! him did you leave,                <br />
                     Second to none, unseconded by you,                <br />
                     To look upon the hideous god of war                <br />
                     In disadvantage; to abide a field                <br />
                     Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name                <br />
                     Did seem defensible: so you left him.                <br />
                     Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong                <br />
                     To hold your honour more precise and nice                <br />
                     With others than with him! let them alone:                <br />

                     He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;                <br />

                     Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a dish                <br />
                     of apple-johns before him, and told him there were                <br />

                     swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master                <br />

                     But that necessity so bow'd the state                <br />
                     That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:                <br />
                     'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,                <br />
                     'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,                <br />
                     Shall break into corruption:' so went on,                <br />
                     Foretelling this same time's condition                <br />
                     And the division of our amity.                <br />

                     There is a history in all men's lives,                <br />
                     Figuring the nature of the times deceased;                <br />
                     The which observed, a man may prophesy,                <br />
                     With a near aim, of the main chance of things                <br />
                     As yet not come to life, which in their seeds                <br />
                     And weak beginnings lie intreasured.                <br />
                     Such things become the hatch and brood of time;                <br />
                     And by the necessary form of this                <br />
                     King Richard might create a perfect guess                <br />
                     That great Northumberland, then false to him,                <br />
                     Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;                <br />
                     Which should not find a ground to root upon,                <br />
                     Unless on you.                <br />

                     Are these things then necessities?                <br />
                     Then let us meet them like necessities:                <br />
                     And that same word even now cries out on us:                <br />
                     They say the bishop and Northumberland                <br />

                     A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was                <br />
                     once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will                <br />
                     talk of mad Shallow yet.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">SILENCE</b>
                     You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SHALLOW</b>
                     By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would                <br />
                     have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.                <br />
                     There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,                <br />
                     and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and                <br />
                     Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such                <br />
                     swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: and                <br />
                     I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were                <br />
                     and had the best of them all at commandment. Then                <br />
                     was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to                <br />
                     Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.                <br />

                     The same Sir John, the very same. I  see him break                <br />
                     Skogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was a                <br />
                     crack not thus high: and the very same day did I                <br />
                     fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,                <br />
                     behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I                <br />
                     have spent! and to see how many of my old                <br />
                     acquaintance are dead!                <br />

                     betted much money on his head. Dead! a' would have                <br />

                     indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever                <br />
                     were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of                <br />

                     command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a                <br />
                     man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,                <br />

                     Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that                <br />

                     well said, Sir John, very well said.                <br />

                     I was pricked well enough before, an you could have                <br />
                     let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for                <br />
                     one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need                <br />
                     not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter                <br />
                     to go out than I.                <br />

                     shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of                <br />
                     the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the                <br />
                     father's substance!                <br />

                     Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have                <br />
                     a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.                <br />

                     It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon                <br />
                     his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:                <br />

                     ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in                <br />
                     an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">FEEBLE</b>
                     I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.                <br />

                     mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him                <br />
                     to a private soldier that is the leader of so many                <br />

                     with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his                <br />
                     dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'                <br />

                     monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came                <br />
                     ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those                <br />
                     tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the                <br />
                     carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or                <br />
                     his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger                <br />
                     become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a                <br />
                     Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and                <br />
                     I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the                <br />
                     Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding                <br />
                     among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a                <br />
                     Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have                <br />
                     thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the                <br />
                     case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a                <br />
                     court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll                <br />
                     be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall                <br />
                     go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two                <br />
                     stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the                <br />
                     old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I                <br />
                     may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.                <br />

                     My friends and brethren in these great affairs,                <br />
                     I must acquaint you that I have received                <br />
                     New-dated letters from Northumberland;                <br />

                     Here doth he wish his person, with such powers                <br />
                     As might hold sortance with his quality,                <br />
                     The which he could not levy; whereupon                <br />
                     He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,                <br />
                     To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers                <br />
                     That your attempts may overlive the hazard                <br />

                     And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number                <br />

                     Unto your grace do I in chief address                <br />
                     The substance of my speech. If that rebellion                <br />
                     Came like itself, in base and abject routs,                <br />
                     Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,                <br />
                     And countenanced by boys and beggary,                <br />
                     I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,                <br />
                     In his true, native and most proper shape,                <br />
                     You, reverend father, and these noble lords                <br />
                     Had not been here, to dress the ugly form                <br />
                     Of base and bloody insurrection                <br />
                     With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,                <br />
                     Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,                <br />
                     Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,                <br />
                     Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,                <br />
                     Whose white investments figure innocence,                <br />
                     The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,                <br />
                     Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself                <br />
                     Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,                <br />
                     Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;                <br />
                     Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,                <br />
                     Your pens to lances and your tongue divine                <br />
                     To a trumpet and a point of war?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b>
                     Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.                <br />
                     Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,                <br />
                     And with our surfeiting and wanton hours                <br />
                     Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,                <br />
                     And we must bleed for it; of which disease                <br />
                     Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.                <br />
                     But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,                <br />
                     I take not on me here as a physician,                <br />
                     Nor do I as an enemy to peace                <br />
                     Troop in the throngs of military men;                <br />
                     But rather show awhile like fearful war,                <br />
                     To diet rank minds sick of happiness                <br />
                     And purge the obstructions which begin to stop                <br />
                     Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.                <br />
                     I have in equal balance justly weigh'd                <br />
                     What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,                <br />
                     And find our griefs heavier than our offences.                <br />
                     We see which way the stream of time doth run,                <br />
                     And are enforced from our most quiet there                <br />
                     By the rough torrent of occasion;                <br />
                     And have the summary of all our griefs,                <br />
                     When time shall serve, to show in articles;                <br />
                     Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,                <br />
                     And might by no suit gain our audience:                <br />
                     When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,                <br />
                     We are denied access unto his person                <br />
                     Even by those men that most have done us wrong.                <br />
                     The dangers of the days but newly gone,                <br />
                     Whose memory is written on the earth                <br />
                     With yet appearing blood, and the examples                <br />
                     Of every minute's instance, present now,                <br />
                     Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,                <br />
                     Not to break peace or any branch of it,                <br />
                     But to establish here a peace indeed,                <br />
                     Concurring both in name and quality.                <br />

                     O, my good Lord Mowbray,                <br />
                     Construe the times to their necessities,                <br />
                     And you shall say indeed, it is the time,                <br />

                     Yet for your part, it not appears to me                <br />
                     Either from the king or in the present time                <br />
                     That you should have an inch of any ground                <br />
                     To build a grief on: were you not restored                <br />

                     That need to be revived and breathed in me?                <br />
                     The king that loved him, as the state stood then,                <br />
                     Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:                <br />

                     Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,                <br />
                     Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,                <br />
                     Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel                <br />
                     And the loud trumpet blowing them together,                <br />

                     His own life hung upon the staff he threw;                <br />
                     Then threw he down himself and all their lives                <br />
                     That by indictment and by dint of sword                <br />

                     You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.                <br />
                     The Earl of Hereford was reputed then                <br />
                     In England the most valiant gentlemen:                <br />
                     Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?                <br />
                     But if your father had been victor there,                <br />
                     He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:                <br />
                     For all the country in a general voice                <br />
                     Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love                <br />
                     Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on                <br />
                     And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.                <br />
                     But this is mere digression from my purpose.                <br />
                     Here come I from our princely general                <br />
                     To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace                <br />
                     That he will give you audience; and wherein                <br />
                     It shall appear that your demands are just,                <br />
                     You shall enjoy them, every thing set off                <br />
                     That might so much as think you enemies.                <br />

                     But he hath forced us to compel this offer;                <br />
                     And it proceeds from policy, not love.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</b>
                     Mowbray, you overween to take it so;                <br />
                     This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:                <br />
                     For, lo! within a ken our army lies,                <br />
                     Upon mine honour, all too confident                <br />
                     To give admittance to a thought of fear.                <br />
                     Our battle is more full of names than yours,                <br />
                     Our men more perfect in the use of arms,                <br />
                     Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;                <br />
                     Then reason will our heart should be as good                <br />
                     Say you not then our offer is compell'd.                <br />

                     We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind                <br />

            <b class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b>
                     No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary                <br />
                     Of dainty and such picking grievances:                <br />
                     For he hath found to end one doubt by death                <br />
                     Revives two greater in the heirs of life,                <br />
                     And therefore will he wipe his tables clean                <br />
                     And keep no tell-tale to his memory                <br />
                     That may repeat and history his loss                <br />
                     To new remembrance; for full well he knows                <br />
                     He cannot so precisely weed this land                <br />
                     As his misdoubts present occasion:                <br />
                     His foes are so enrooted with his friends                <br />
                     That, plucking to unfix an enemy,                <br />
                     He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:                <br />
                     So that this land, like an offensive wife                <br />
                     That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,                <br />
                     As he is striking, holds his infant up                <br />
                     And hangs resolved correction in the arm                <br />

                     Good my Lord of Lancaster,                <br />
                     I am not here against your father's peace;                <br />
                     But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,                <br />
                     The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,                <br />
                     Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,                <br />
                     To hold our safety up. I sent your grace                <br />
                     The parcels and particulars of our grief,                <br />
                     The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,                <br />
                     Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;                <br />
                     Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep                <br />
                     With grant of our most just and right desires,                <br />
                     And true obedience, of this madness cured,                <br />
                     Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">MOWBRAY</b>
                     If not, we ready are to try our fortunes                <br />
                     To the last man.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">HASTINGS</b>
                     And though we here fall down,                <br />
                     We have supplies to second our attempt:                <br />
                     If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;                <br />
                     And so success of mischief shall be born                <br />
                     And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up                <br />
                     Whiles England shall have generation.                <br />

                     You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,                <br />
                     To sound the bottom of the after-times.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</b>
                     Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly                <br />
                     How far forth you do like their articles.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">LANCASTER</b>
                     I like them all, and do allow them well,                <br />
                     And swear here, by the honour of my blood,                <br />
                     My father's purposes have been mistook,                <br />
                     And some about him have too lavishly                <br />
                     Wrested his meaning and authority.                <br />
                     My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;                <br />
                     Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,                <br />
                     Discharge your powers unto their several counties,                <br />
                     As we will ours: and here between the armies                <br />
                     Let's drink together friendly and embrace,                <br />
                     That all their eyes may bear those tokens home                <br />
                     Of our restored love and amity.                <br />

          <p>

                     I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains                <br />
                     I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,                <br />
                     You would drink freely: but my love to ye                <br />
                     Shall show itself more openly hereafter.                <br />

                     You wish me health in very happy season;                <br />
                     For I am, on the sudden, something ill.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b>
                     Against ill chances men are ever merry;                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WESTMORELAND</b>
                     Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow                <br />
                     Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes                <br />

                     A peace is of the nature of a conquest;                <br />
                     For then both parties nobly are subdued,                <br />

                     in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.                <br />

                     Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?                <br />
                     When every thing is ended, then you come:                <br />
                     These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,                <br />
                     One time or other break some gallows' back.                <br />

                     I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I                <br />
                     never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward                <br />
                     of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a                <br />
                     bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the                <br />
                     expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with                <br />
                     the very extremest inch of possibility; I have                <br />
                     foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,                <br />
                     travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and                <br />
                     immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the                <br />
                     dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.                <br />
                     But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I                <br />
                     may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,                <br />
                     'I came, saw, and overcame.'                <br />

                     I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than                <br />
                     your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-                <br />
                     blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make                <br />
                     him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.                <br />
                     There's never none of these demure boys come to any                <br />
                     proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,                <br />
                     and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a                <br />
                     kind of male green-sickness; and then when they                <br />
                     marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools                <br />
                     and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for                <br />
                     inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold                <br />
                     operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;                <br />
                     dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy                <br />
                     vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,                <br />
                     quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and                <br />
                     delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the                <br />
                     voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes                <br />
                     excellent wit. The second property of your                <br />
                     excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;                <br />
                     which, before cold and settled, left the liver                <br />
                     white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity                <br />
                     and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes                <br />
                     it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:                <br />
                     it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives                <br />
                     warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,                <br />
                     man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and                <br />
                     inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,                <br />
                     the heart, who, great and puffed up with this                <br />
                     retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour                <br />
                     comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is                <br />
                     nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and                <br />
                     learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till                <br />
                     sack commences it and sets it in act and use.                <br />
                     Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for                <br />
                     the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his                <br />
                     father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,                <br />
                     manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent                <br />
                     endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile                <br />
                     sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If                <br />
                     I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I                <br />
                     would teach them should be, to forswear thin                <br />
                     potations and to addict themselves to sack.                <br />

                     Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.                <br />
                     How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?                <br />
                     He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;                <br />
                     Thou hast a better place in his affection                <br />
                     Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,                <br />
                     And noble offices thou mayst effect                <br />
                     Of mediation, after I am dead,                <br />
                     Between his greatness and thy other brethren:                <br />
                     Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,                <br />
                     Nor lose the good advantage of his grace                <br />
                     By seeming cold or careless of his will;                <br />
                     For he is gracious, if he be observed:                <br />
                     He hath a tear for pity and a hand                <br />
                     Open as day for melting charity:                <br />
                     Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,                <br />
                     As humorous as winter and as sudden                <br />
                     As flaws congealed in the spring of day.                <br />
                     His temper, therefore, must be well observed:                <br />
                     Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,                <br />
                     When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;                <br />
                     But, being moody, give him line and scope,                <br />
                     Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,                <br />
                     Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,                <br />
                     And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,                <br />
                     A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,                <br />

                     Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,                <br />
                     Being so troublesome a bedfellow?                <br />
                     O polish'd perturbation! golden care!                <br />
                     That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide                <br />
                     To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!                <br />
                     Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet                <br />
                     As he whose brow with homely biggen bound                <br />
                     Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!                <br />
                     When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit                <br />
                     Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,                <br />
                     That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath                <br />
                     There lies a downy feather which stirs not:                <br />
                     Did he suspire, that light and weightless down                <br />
                     Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!                <br />
                     This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep                <br />
                     That from this golden rigol hath divorced                <br />
                     So many English kings. Thy due from me                <br />
                     Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,                <br />
                     Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,                <br />
                     Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:                <br />
                     My due from thee is this imperial crown,                <br />
                     Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,                <br />
                     Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,                <br />
                     Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength                <br />
                     Into one giant arm, it shall not force                <br />
                     This lineal honour from me: this from thee                <br />
                     Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.                <br />

                     Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair                <br />
                     That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours                <br />
                     Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!                <br />
                     Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.                <br />
                     Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity                <br />
                     Is held from falling with so weak a wind                <br />
                     That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.                <br />
                     Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours                <br />
                     Were thine without offence; and at my death                <br />

                     Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,                <br />
                     Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,                <br />
                     To stab at half an hour of my life.                <br />
                     What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?                <br />
                     Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,                <br />

                     England shall double gild his treble guilt,                <br />
                     England shall give him office, honour, might;                <br />

                     The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog                <br />
                     Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.                <br />

                     When that my care could not withhold thy riots,                <br />
                     What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?                <br />
                     O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,                <br />

                     O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,                <br />
                     The moist impediments unto my speech,                <br />
                     I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke                <br />
                     Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard                <br />
                     The course of it so far. There is your crown;                <br />
                     And He that wears the crown immortally                <br />
                     Long guard it yours! If I affect it more                <br />
                     Than as your honour and as your renown,                <br />
                     Let me no more from this obedience rise,                <br />
                     Which my most inward true and duteous spirit                <br />
                     Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.                <br />
                     God witness with me, when I here came in,                <br />
                     And found no course of breath within your majesty,                <br />
                     How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,                <br />
                     O, let me in my present wildness die                <br />
                     And never live to show the incredulous world                <br />
                     The noble change that I have purposed!                <br />
                     Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,                <br />
                     And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,                <br />
                     I spake unto this crown as having sense,                <br />
                     And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending                <br />
                     Hath fed upon the body of my father;                <br />
                     Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:                <br />
                     Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,                <br />
                     Preserving life in medicine potable;                <br />
                     But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,                <br />
                     Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,                <br />
                     Accusing it, I put it on my head,                <br />
                     To try with it, as with an enemy                <br />
                     That had before my face murder'd my father,                <br />
                     The quarrel of a true inheritor.                <br />
                     But if it did infect my blood with joy,                <br />
                     Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;                <br />
                     If any rebel or vain spirit of mine                <br />
                     Did with the least affection of a welcome                <br />
                     Give entertainment to the might of it,                <br />
                     Let God for ever keep it from my head                <br />
                     And make me as the poorest vassal is                <br />
                     That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!                <br />

                     O my son,                <br />
                     God put it in thy mind to take it hence,                <br />
                     That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,                <br />
                     Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!                <br />
                     Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;                <br />
                     And hear, I think, the very latest counsel                <br />
                     That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,                <br />
                     By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways                <br />
                     I met this crown; and I myself know well                <br />
                     How troublesome it sat upon my head.                <br />
                     To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,                <br />
                     Better opinion, better confirmation;                <br />
                     For all the soil of the achievement goes                <br />
                     With me into the earth. It seem'd in me                <br />
                     But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,                <br />
                     And I had many living to upbraid                <br />
                     My gain of it by their assistances;                <br />
                     Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,                <br />
                     Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears                <br />
                     Thou see'st with peril I have answered;                <br />
                     For all my reign hath been but as a scene                <br />
                     Acting that argument: and now my death                <br />
                     Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,                <br />
                     Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;                <br />
                     So thou the garland wear'st successively.                <br />
                     Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,                <br />
                     Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;                <br />
                     And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,                <br />
                     Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;                <br />
                     By whose fell working I was first advanced                <br />
                     And by whose power I well might lodge a fear                <br />
                     To be again displaced: which to avoid,                <br />
                     I cut them off; and had a purpose now                <br />
                     To lead out many to the Holy Land,                <br />
                     Lest rest and lying still might make them look                <br />
                     Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,                <br />
                     Be it thy course to busy giddy minds                <br />
                     With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,                <br />
                     May waste the memory of the former days.                <br />
                     More would I, but my lungs are wasted so                <br />
                     That strength of speech is utterly denied me.                <br />
                     How I came by the crown, O God forgive;                <br />
                     And grant it may with thee in true peace live!                <br />

                     Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the                <br />
                     court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men                <br />
                     well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">DAVY</b>
                     No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they                <br />
                     have marvellous foul linen.                <br />

                     I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of                <br />

            <b class="speaker">SHALLOW</b>
                     There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:                <br />
                     that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.                <br />

                     I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but                <br />
                     yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some                <br />
                     countenance at his friend's request. An honest                <br />
                     man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave                <br />
                     is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,                <br />
                     this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in                <br />
                     a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I                <br />
                     have but a very little credit with your worship. The                <br />
                     knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I                <br />
                     beseech your worship, let him be countenanced.                <br />

                     If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four                <br />
                     dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master                <br />
                     Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the                <br />
                     semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:                <br />
                     they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like                <br />
                     foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is                <br />
                     turned into a justice-like serving-man: their                <br />
                     spirits are so married in conjunction with the                <br />
                     participation of society that they flock together in                <br />
                     consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit                <br />
                     to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the                <br />
                     imputation of being near their master: if to his                <br />
                     men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man                <br />
                     could better command his servants. It is certain                <br />
                     that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is                <br />
                     caught, as men take diseases, one of another:                <br />
                     therefore let men take heed of their company. I                <br />
                     will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to                <br />
                     keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing                <br />
                     out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two                <br />
                     actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,                <br />
                     it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest                <br />
                     with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never                <br />
                     had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him                <br />

                     You all look strangely on me: and you most;                <br />
                     You are, I think, assured I love you not.                <br />

                     I am assured, if I be measured rightly,                <br />
                     Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.                <br />

                     How might a prince of my great hopes forget                <br />
                     So great indignities you laid upon me?                <br />
                     What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison                <br />
                     The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?                <br />

                     I then did use the person of your father;                <br />
                     The image of his power lay then in me:                <br />
                     And, in the administration of his law,                <br />
                     Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,                <br />
                     Your highness pleased to forget my place,                <br />
                     The majesty and power of law and justice,                <br />
                     The image of the king whom I presented,                <br />
                     And struck me in my very seat of judgment;                <br />
                     Whereon, as an offender to your father,                <br />
                     I gave bold way to my authority                <br />
                     And did commit you. If the deed were ill,                <br />
                     Be you contented, wearing now the garland,                <br />
                     To have a son set your decrees at nought,                <br />
                     To pluck down justice from your awful bench,                <br />
                     To trip the course of law and blunt the sword                <br />
                     That guards the peace and safety of your person;                <br />
                     Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image                <br />
                     And mock your workings in a second body.                <br />
                     Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;                <br />
                     Be now the father and propose a son,                <br />
                     Hear your own dignity so much profaned,                <br />
                     See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,                <br />
                     Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;                <br />
                     And then imagine me taking your part                <br />
                     And in your power soft silencing your son:                <br />
                     After this cold considerance, sentence me;                <br />
                     And, as you are a king, speak in your state                <br />
                     What I have done that misbecame my place,                <br />
                     My person, or my liege's sovereignty.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;                <br />
                     Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:                <br />
                     And I do wish your honours may increase,                <br />
                     Till you do live to see a son of mine                <br />
                     Offend you and obey you, as I did.                <br />
                     So shall I live to speak my father's words:                <br />
                     'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,                <br />
                     That dares do justice on my proper son;                <br />
                     And not less happy, having such a son,                <br />
                     That would deliver up his greatness so                <br />
                     Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:                <br />
                     For which, I do commit into your hand                <br />
                     The unstained sword that you have used to bear;                <br />
                     With this remembrance, that you use the same                <br />
                     With the like bold, just and impartial spirit                <br />
                     As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.                <br />
                     You shall be as a father to my youth:                <br />
                     My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,                <br />
                     And I will stoop and humble my intents                <br />
                     To your well-practised wise directions.                <br />
                     And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;                <br />
                     My father is gone wild into his grave,                <br />
                     For in his tomb lie my affections;                <br />
                     And with his spirit sadly I survive,                <br />
                     To mock the expectation of the world,                <br />
                     To frustrate prophecies and to raze out                <br />
                     Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down                <br />
                     After my seeming. The tide of blood in me                <br />
                     Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:                <br />
                     Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,                <br />
                     Where it shall mingle with the state of floods                <br />
                     And flow henceforth in formal majesty.                <br />
                     Now call we our high court of parliament:                <br />
                     And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,                <br />
                     That the great body of our state may go                <br />
                     In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;                <br />
                     That war, or peace, or both at once, may be                <br />
                     As things acquainted and familiar to us;                <br />
                     In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.                <br />
                     Our coronation done, we will accite,                <br />
                     As I before remember'd, all our state:                <br />
                     And, God consigning to my good intents,                <br />
                     No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,                <br />
                     God shorten Harry's happy life one day!                <br />

                     The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Lord Chief-Justice</b>
                     He hath.                <br />

                     I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,                <br />
                     We bear our civil swords and native fire                <br />
                     As far as France: I heard a bird so sing,                <br />
                     Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.                <br />
                     Come, will you hence?                <br />
