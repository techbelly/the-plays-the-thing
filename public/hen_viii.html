                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Bark when their fellows do: by some of these

                     The queen is put in anger. You're excused:

                     But will you be more justified? You ever

                     Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired

                     It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,

                     The passages made toward it: on my honour,

                     I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,

                     And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,

                     I will be bold with time and your attention:

                     Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:

                     My conscience first received a tenderness,

                     By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;

                     Who had been hither sent on the debating

                     A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and

                     Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,
                  
                <br />

                     I mean the bishop, did require a respite;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Whether our daughter were legitimate,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The region of my breast; which forced such way,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That many mazed considerings did throng
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If it conceived a male child by me, should
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Do no more offices of life to't than
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or died where they were made, or shortly after

                     This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Toward this remedy, whereupon we are

                     I meant to rectify my conscience,--which
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--

                     Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:

                     Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!

                     Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That no king can corrupt.

                     The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,

                     Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;

                     But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?

                     The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?

                     I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;

                     The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.

                     Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye

                     Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?

                     Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,

                     His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,

                     And all the fellowship I hold now with him
                  
                <br />

                     Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?

                     You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,

                     And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,

                     There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,

                     The king has gone beyond me: all my glories

                     In that one woman I have lost for ever:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Or gild again the noble troops that waited
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;

                     That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him

                     Some little memory of me will stir him--

                     Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear

                     In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;

                     And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,

                     And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention

                     Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,

                     And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,

                     Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;

                     A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.

                     Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:

                     By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?

                     Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Corruption wins not more than honesty.

                     Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,
                  
                <br />

                     Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And,--prithee, lead me in:

                     There take an inventory of all I have,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,

                     And my integrity to heaven, is all

                     A distance from her; while her grace sat down

                     The beauty of her person to the people.

                     Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That ever lay by man: which when the people

                     Had the full view of, such a noise arose

                     As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,

                     As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--

                     Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy

                     I never saw before. Great-bellied women,

                     That had not half a week to go, like rams

                     In the old time of war, would shake the press,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven

                     So strangely in one piece.

                     At length her grace rose, and with modest paces

                     Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like

                     Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     When by the Archbishop of Canterbury

                     She had all the royal makings of a queen;

                     As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,

                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     About the hour of eight, which he himself

                     Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He gave his honours to the world again,

                     His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.

                     So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!

                     Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And yet with charity. He was a man
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     His own opinion was his law: i' the presence
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He would say untruths; and be ever double
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Both in his words and meaning: he was never,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But his performance, as he is now, nothing:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Of his own body he was ill, and gave

                     This cardinal,

                     That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.

                     Than man could give him, he died fearing God.

another, six personages, clad in white robes,
wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden
vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in
their hands. They first congee unto her, then
dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold
a spare garland over her head; at which the other
four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held
the garland deliver the same to the other next two,
who observe the same order in their changes, and
holding the garland over her head: which done,
they deliver the same garland to the last two, who
likewise observe the same order: at which, as it
were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs
of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:
and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the
garland with them. The music continues</p>

                     She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;

                     The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:

                     And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Would I had known no more! but she must die,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     A most unspotted lily shall she pass
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.

                     O lord archbishop,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thou hast made me now a man! never, before
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     This happy child, did I get any thing:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That when I am in heaven I shall desire
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And your good brethren, I am much beholding;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     I have received much honour by your presence,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She will be sick else. This day, no man think
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Has business at his house; for all shall stay:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     This little one shall make it holiday.
