<h3>SCENE I.  A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other
Attendants</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
<br />
And by the doom of death end woes and all.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
<br />
I am not partial to infringe our laws:
<br />
The enmity and discord which of late
<br />
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
<br />
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
<br />
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
<br />
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
<br />
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
<br />
For, since the mortal and intestine jars
<br />
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
<br />
It hath in solemn synods been decreed
<br />
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
<br />
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
<br />
If any born at Ephesus be seen
<br />
At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
<br />
Again: if any Syracusian born
<br />
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
<br />
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
<br />
Unless a thousand marks be levied,
<br />
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
<br />
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
<br />
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
<br />
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
<br />
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
<br />
Why thou departed'st from thy native home
<br />
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
A heavier task could not have been imposed
<br />
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
<br />
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
<br />
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
<br />
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
<br />
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
<br />
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
<br />
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
<br />
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
<br />
By prosperous voyages I often made
<br />
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
<br />
And the great care of goods at random left
<br />
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
<br />
From whom my absence was not six months old
<br />
Before herself, almost at fainting under
<br />
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
<br />
Had made provision for her following me
<br />
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
<br />
There had she not been long, but she became
<br />
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
<br />
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
<br />
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
<br />
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
<br />
A meaner woman was delivered
<br />
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
<br />
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
<br />
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
<br />
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
<br />
Made daily motions for our home return:
<br />
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
<br />
We came aboard.
<br />
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
<br />
Before the always wind-obeying deep
<br />
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
<br />
But longer did we not retain much hope;
<br />
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
<br />
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
<br />
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
<br />
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
<br />
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
<br />
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
<br />
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
<br />
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
<br />
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
<br />
And this it was, for other means was none:
<br />
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
<br />
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
<br />
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
<br />
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
<br />
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
<br />
To him one of the other twins was bound,
<br />
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
<br />
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
<br />
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
<br />
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
<br />
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
<br />
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
<br />
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
<br />
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
<br />
And by the benefit of his wished light,
<br />
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
<br />
Two ships from far making amain to us,
<br />
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
<br />
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
<br />
Gather the sequel by that went before.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
<br />
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
O, had the gods done so, I had not now
<br />
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
<br />
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
<br />
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
<br />
Which being violently borne upon,
<br />
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
<br />
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
<br />
Fortune had left to both of us alike
<br />
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
<br />
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
<br />
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
<br />
Was carried with more speed before the wind;
<br />
And in our sight they three were taken up
<br />
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
<br />
At length, another ship had seized on us;
<br />
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
<br />
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
<br />
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
<br />
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
<br />
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
<br />
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
<br />
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
<br />
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
<br />
Do me the favour to dilate at full
<br />
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
<br />
At eighteen years became inquisitive
<br />
After his brother: and importuned me
<br />
That his attendant--so his case was like,
<br />
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
<br />
Might bear him company in the quest of him:
<br />
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
<br />
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
<br />
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
<br />
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
<br />
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
<br />
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
<br />
Or that or any place that harbours men.
<br />
But here must end the story of my life;
<br />
And happy were I in my timely death,
<br />
Could all my travels warrant me they live.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
<br />
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
<br />
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
<br />
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
<br />
Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
<br />
My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
<br />
But, though thou art adjudged to the death
<br />
And passed sentence may not be recall'd
<br />
But to our honour's great disparagement,
<br />
Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
<br />
Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
<br />
To seek thy life by beneficial help:
<br />
Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
<br />
Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
<br />
And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
<br />
Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Gaoler</b>
I will, my lord.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
<br />
But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
<br />

<h3>SCENE II.  The Mart. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse,
and First Merchant</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Merchant</b>
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
<br />
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
<br />
This very day a Syracusian merchant
<br />
Is apprehended for arrival here;
<br />
And not being able to buy out his life
<br />
According to the statute of the town,
<br />
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
<br />
There is your money that I had to keep.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
<br />
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
<br />
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
<br />
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
<br />
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
<br />
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
<br />
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
<br />
Get thee away.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Many a man would take you at your word,
<br />
And go indeed, having so good a mean.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
<br />
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
<br />
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
<br />
What, will you walk with me about the town,
<br />
And then go to my inn and dine with me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Merchant</b>
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
<br />
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
<br />
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
<br />
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
<br />
And afterward consort you till bed-time:
<br />
My present business calls me from you now.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
<br />
And wander up and down to view the city.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">First Merchant</b>
Sir, I commend you to your own content.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
He that commends me to mine own content
<br />
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
<br />
I to the world am like a drop of water
<br />
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
<br />
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
<br />
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
<br />
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
<br />
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</i><br />
Here comes the almanac of my true date.
<br />
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
<br />
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
<br />
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
<br />
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
<br />
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
<br />
The meat is cold because you come not home;
<br />
You come not home because you have no stomach;
<br />
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
<br />
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
<br />
Are penitent for your default to-day.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
<br />
Where have you left the money that I gave you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
<br />
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
<br />
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
I am not in a sportive humour now:
<br />
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
<br />
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
<br />
So great a charge from thine own custody?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
<br />
I from my mistress come to you in post;
<br />
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
<br />
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
<br />
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
<br />
And strike you home without a messenger.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
<br />
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
<br />
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
<br />
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
<br />
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
<br />
My mistress and her sister stays for you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
<br />
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
<br />
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
<br />
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
<br />
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
<br />
But not a thousand marks between you both.
<br />
If I should pay your worship those again,
<br />
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
<br />
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
<br />
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
<br />
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
<br />
Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Upon my life, by some device or other
<br />
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
<br />
They say this town is full of cozenage,
<br />
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
<br />
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
<br />
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
<br />
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
<br />
And many such-like liberties of sin:
<br />
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
<br />
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
<br />
I greatly fear my money is not safe.

<h3>SCENE I.  The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
<br />
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
<br />
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
<br />
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
<br />
Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
<br />
A man is master of his liberty:
<br />
Time is their master, and, when they see time,
<br />
They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Why should their liberty than ours be more?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Because their business still lies out o' door.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
O, know he is the bridle of your will.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
There's none but asses will be bridled so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
<br />
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
<br />
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
<br />
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
<br />
Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
<br />
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
<br />
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
<br />
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
<br />
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
<br />
Are masters to their females, and their lords:
<br />
Then let your will attend on their accords.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
How if your husband start some other where?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Till he come home again, I would forbear.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
<br />
They can be meek that have no other cause.
<br />
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
<br />
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
<br />
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
<br />
As much or more would we ourselves complain:
<br />
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
<br />
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
<br />
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
<br />
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
<br />
Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</p>

Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
<br />
can witness.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
<br />
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
<br />
blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
<br />
understand them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
<br />
hath great care to please his wife.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Horn-mad, thou villain!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
I mean not cuckold-mad;
<br />
But, sure, he is stark mad.
<br />
When I desired him to come home to dinner,
<br />
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
<br />
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
<br />
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
<br />
'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
<br />
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
<br />
'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
<br />
'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
<br />
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Quoth who?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Quoth my master:
<br />
'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
<br />
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
<br />
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
<br />
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Go back again, and be new beaten home?
<br />
For God's sake, send some other messenger.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
And he will bless that cross with other beating:
<br />
Between you I shall have a holy head.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Am I so round with you as you with me,
<br />
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
<br />
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
<br />
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
<br />
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
<br />
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
<br />
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
<br />
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
<br />
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
<br />
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
<br />
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
<br />
What ruins are in me that can be found,
<br />
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
<br />
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
<br />
A sunny look of his would soon repair
<br />
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
<br />
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
<br />
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
<br />
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
<br />
Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
<br />
Would that alone, alone he would detain,
<br />
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
<br />
I see the jewel best enamelled
<br />
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
<br />
That others touch, and often touching will
<br />
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
<br />
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
<br />
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
<br />
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

<h3>SCENE II.  A public place. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
<br />
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
<br />
Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
<br />
By computation and mine host's report.
<br />
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
<br />
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Enter DROMIO of Syracuse</i><br />
How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
<br />
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
<br />
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
<br />
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
<br />
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
<br />
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
I did not see you since you sent me hence,
<br />
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
<br />
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
<br />
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
<br />
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
<br />
Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Beating him</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
<br />
Upon what bargain do you give it me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Because that I familiarly sometimes
<br />
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
<br />
Your sauciness will jest upon my love
<br />
And make a common of my serious hours.
<br />
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
<br />
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
<br />
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
<br />
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
<br />
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
<br />
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
<br />
long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
<br />
it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
<br />
But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Dost thou not know?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Shall I tell you why?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
<br />
a wherefore.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
<br />
For urging it the second time to me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
<br />
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
<br />
nor reason?
<br />
Well, sir, I thank you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Thank me, sir, for what?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
<br />
something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
In good time, sir; what's that?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Basting.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Your reason?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
<br />
dry basting.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
<br />
time for all things.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
By what rule, sir?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
<br />
pate of father Time himself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Let's hear it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
<br />
grows bald by nature.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
May he not do it by fine and recovery?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
<br />
lost hair of another man.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
<br />
so plentiful an excrement?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
<br />
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
<br />
it in a kind of jollity.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
For what reason?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
For two; and sound ones too.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Nay, not sound, I pray you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Sure ones, then.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Certain ones then.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Name them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
The one, to save the money that he spends in
<br />
trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
<br />
drop in his porridge.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
You would all this time have proved there is no
<br />
time for all things.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
<br />
lost by nature.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
<br />
time to recover.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
<br />
to the world's end will have bald followers.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
<br />
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
<br />
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
<br />
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
<br />
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
<br />
That never words were music to thine ear,
<br />
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
<br />
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
<br />
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
<br />
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
<br />
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
<br />
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
<br />
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
<br />
That, undividable, incorporate,
<br />
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
<br />
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
<br />
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
<br />
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
<br />
And take unmingled that same drop again,
<br />
Without addition or diminishing,
<br />
As take from me thyself and not me too.
<br />
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
<br />
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
<br />
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
<br />
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
<br />
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
<br />
And hurl the name of husband in my face
<br />
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
<br />
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
<br />
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
<br />
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
<br />
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
<br />
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
<br />
For if we too be one and thou play false,
<br />
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
<br />
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
<br />
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
<br />
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
<br />
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
<br />
As strange unto your town as to your talk;
<br />
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
<br />
Want wit in all one word to understand.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
<br />
When were you wont to use my sister thus?

<p>

That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
<br />
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
<br />
What is the course and drift of your compact?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
<br />
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
I never spake with her in all my life.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
How can she thus then call us by our names,
<br />
Unless it be by inspiration.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
How ill agrees it with your gravity
<br />
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
<br />
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
<br />
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
<br />
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
<br />
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
<br />
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
<br />
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
<br />
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
<br />
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
<br />
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
<br />
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
<br />
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
<br />
What, was I married to her in my dream?
<br />
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
<br />
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
<br />
Until I know this sure uncertainty,
<br />
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
<br />
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
<br />
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
<br />
If we obey them not, this will ensue,
<br />
They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
<br />
</p>

<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?

Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.

<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
<br />
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
<br />
But I should know her as well as she knows me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
<br />
To put the finger in the eye and weep,

Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
<br />
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
<br />
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
<br />
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
<br />
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,

Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
<br />
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
<br />

Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?

Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?

And in this mist at all adventures go.

ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">OF EPHESUS</b>
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
<br />
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
<br />
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
<br />
To see the making of her carcanet,
<br />
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
<br />
But here's a villain that would face me down
<br />
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
<br />
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
<br />
And that I did deny my wife and house.
<br />
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
<br />
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
<br />
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
<br />
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
I think thou art an ass.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Marry, so it doth appear
<br />
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
<br />
I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
<br />
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.

O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
<br />
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">BALTHAZAR</b>
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.
<br />
</p>
<p>

Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.

Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:

But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;

Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
<br />
Herein you war against your reputation

And draw within the compass of suspect
<br />
The unviolated honour of your wife.
<br />
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
<br />
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
<br />
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
<br />
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
<br />
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
<br />
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
<br />
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
<br />
And about evening come yourself alone
<br />
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
<br />
If by strong hand you offer to break in
<br />
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
<br />
A vulgar comment will be made of it,

And that supposed by the common rout

<br />
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,

To her will we to dinner.

Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--

Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.

<h3>SCENE II.  The same. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
And may it be that you have quite forgot
<br />
A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
<br />
Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
<br />
Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
<br />
If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
<br />
Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
<br />
Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
<br />
Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
<br />
Let not my sister read it in your eye;
<br />
Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
<br />
Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
<br />
Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
<br />
Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
<br />
Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
<br />
Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
<br />
What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
<br />
'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
<br />
And let her read it in thy looks at board:
<br />
Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
<br />
Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.
<br />
Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
<br />
Being compact of credit, that you love us;
<br />
Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
<br />
We in your motion turn and you may move us.
<br />
Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
<br />
Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
<br />
'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
<br />
When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
<br />
Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
<br />
Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
<br />
Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
<br />
Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
<br />
Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
<br />
Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
<br />
The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
<br />
Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
<br />
To make it wander in an unknown field?
<br />
Are you a god? would you create me new?
<br />
Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
<br />
But if that I am I, then well I know
<br />
Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
<br />
Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
<br />
Far more, far more to you do I decline.
<br />
O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
<br />
To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
<br />
Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
<br />
Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
<br />
And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
<br />
And in that glorious supposition think
<br />
He gains by death that hath such means to die:
<br />
Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Why call you me love? call my sister so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Thy sister's sister.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
That's my sister.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
No;
<br />
It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
<br />
Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
<br />
My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
<br />
My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
All this my sister is, or else should be.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
<br />
Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
<br />
Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
<br />
Give me thy hand.
<br />

Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?
<br />
am I myself?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one
<br />
that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
What claim lays she to thee?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
<br />
horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
<br />
being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
<br />
being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
What is she?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may
<br />
not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
<br />
but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
<br />
wondrous fat marriage.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;
<br />
and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
<br />
lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
<br />
warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
<br />
Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
<br />
she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
What complexion is she of?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so
<br />
clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over
<br />
shoes in the grime of it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
That's a fault that water will mend.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
What's her name?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's
<br />
an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
<br />
hip to hip.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Then she bears some breadth?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
<br />
she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out
<br />
countries in her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
In what part of her body stands Ireland?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Where Scotland?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Where France?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war
<br />
against her heir.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Where England?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no
<br />
whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,
<br />
by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Where Spain?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Where America, the Indies?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with
<br />
rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
<br />
aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
<br />
armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
<br />
drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me
<br />
Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
<br />
privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
<br />
shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
<br />
left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:
<br />
And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
<br />
faith and my heart of steel,
<br />
She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
<br />
me turn i' the wheel.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
<br />
An if the wind blow any way from shore,
<br />
I will not harbour in this town to-night:
<br />
If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
<br />
Where I will walk till thou return to me.
<br />
If every one knows us and we know none,
<br />
'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
As from a bear a man would run for life,
<br />
So fly I from her that would be my wife.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Exit</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
There's none but witches do inhabit here;
<br />
And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
<br />
She that doth call me husband, even my soul
<br />
Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
<br />
Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
<br />
Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
<br />
Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
<br />
But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
<br />
I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
<br />
And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
<br />
Among my wife and her confederates,
<br />
For locking me out of my doors by day.
<br />
But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
<br />
Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.

A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
<br />
I promised your presence and the chain;
<br />
But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
<br />
Belike you thought our love would last too long,
<br />
If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
Saving your merry humour, here's the note
<br />
How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
<br />
The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
<br />
Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
<br />
Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
<br />
I pray you, see him presently discharged,
<br />
For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
I am not furnish'd with the present money;
<br />
Besides, I have some business in the town.
<br />
Good signior, take the stranger to my house
<br />
And with you take the chain and bid my wife
<br />
Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
<br />
Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
<br />
</p>

<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
<br />
Or else you may return without your money.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
<br />
Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
<br />
And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
<br />
Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
<br />
I should have chid you for not bringing it,
<br />
But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Merchant</b>
The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>

<br />
Either send the chain or send me by some token.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
<br />
where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Merchant</b>
My business cannot brook this dalliance.
<br />
Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
<br />
If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
I answer you! what should I answer you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
The money that you owe me for the chain.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
I owe you none till I receive the chain.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
You know I gave it you half an hour since.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
<br />
Consider how it stands upon my credit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Merchant</b>
Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Officer</b>
I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
This touches me in reputation.
<br />
Either consent to pay this sum for me
<br />
Or I attach you by this officer.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Consent to pay thee that I never had!
<br />
Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
<br />
I would not spare my brother in this case,
<br />
If he should scorn me so apparently.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Officer</b>
I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
<br />
But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
<br />
As all the metal in your shop will answer.

And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,

I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought

The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.

The ship is in her trim; the merry wind

What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?

Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
<br />
And told thee to what purpose and what end.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
<br />
You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
I will debate this matter at more leisure

And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
<br />
To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:

Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
<br />
That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
<br />
There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:

Tell her I am arrested in the street

And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!

Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
<br />
Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye

Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
<br />
What observation madest thou in this case
<br />
Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
First he denied you had in him no right.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Then pleaded I for you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
And what said he?
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
With words that in an honest suit might move.
<br />
First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Didst speak him fair?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Have patience, I beseech.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
<br />
My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
<br />
He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
<br />
Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
<br />
Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
<br />
Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Who would be jealous then of such a one?
<br />
No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

Ah, but I think him better than I say,

And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.

My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
<br />
A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
<br />
One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
<br />
A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
<br />
A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
<br />
A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
<br />
countermands
<br />
The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
<br />
A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
<br />
One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.

<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Why, man, what is the matter?

<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
<br />
But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
<br />
Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Go fetch it, sister.
<br />
<i class="stagedir">Exit Luciana</i><br />
This I wonder at,
<br />
That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
<br />
Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
<br />
A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
What, the chain?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:

It was two ere I left him, and now the clock

<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's
<br />
worth, to season.
<br />
Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
<br />
That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
<br />
If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,

Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

There's not a man I meet but doth salute me

And every one doth call me by my name.

Some tender money to me; some invite me;

Some offer me commodities to buy:

Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam

No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a

bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,

that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob

and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed

What, thou meanest an officer?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF SYRACUSE</b>
Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings

any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that

Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any

Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here

she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof

comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as

much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is

written, they appear to men like angels of light:

light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;

A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,

And for the same he promised me a chain:
<br />
Both one and other he denies me now.
<br />
The reason that I gather he is mad,
<br />
Besides this present instance of his rage,
<br />
Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
<br />
Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
<br />
Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
<br />
On purpose shut the doors against his way.
<br />
My way is now to hie home to his house,
<br />
And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
<br />
He rush'd into my house and took perforce
<br />
My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
<br />
For forty ducats is too much to lose.

<b class="speaker">Officer</b>
Good, now, hold thy tongue.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
<br />
your blows.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
<br />
ears. I have served him from the hour of my
<br />
nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
<br />
hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
<br />
heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
<br />
with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
<br />
raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
<br />
it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
<br />
I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
<br />
beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
<br />
lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
<br />
rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
<br />
rope's-end.'
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Wilt thou still talk?
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Beating him</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Courtezan</b>
How say you now? is not your husband mad?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
His incivility confirms no less.
<br />
Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
<br />
Establish him in his true sense again,
<br />
And I will please you what you will demand.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Courtezan</b>
Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PINCH</b>
Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
<br />
</p>

<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Striking him</p>

<b class="speaker">PINCH</b>
I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
<br />
To yield possession to my holy prayers
<br />
And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
<br />
I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
You minion, you, are these your customers?
<br />
Did this companion with the saffron face
<br />
Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
<br />
Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
<br />
And I denied to enter in my house?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
<br />
Where would you had remain'd until this time,
<br />
Free from these slanders and this open shame!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
And did not she herself revile me there?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
And did not I in rage depart from thence?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
<br />
That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PINCH</b>
It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
<br />
And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
<br />
By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
<br />
But surely master, not a rag of money.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
He came to me and I deliver'd it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
And I am witness with her that she did.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
God and the rope-maker bear me witness
<br />
That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PINCH</b>
Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
<br />
I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
<br />
They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
<br />
And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
And, gentle master, I received no gold;
<br />
But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
<br />
And art confederate with a damned pack
<br />
To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
<br />
But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
<br />
That would behold in me this shameful sport.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">Enter three or four, and offer to bind him.
He strives</p>

O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.

More company! The fiend is strong within him.

<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
<br />
I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
<br />
To make a rescue?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Officer</b>
Masters, let him go
<br />
He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">PINCH</b>
Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
<br />
</p>
<p class="stagedir">They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus</p>

What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
<br />
Hast thou delight to see a wretched man

<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Officer</b>
He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
<br />
The debt he owes will be required of me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
<br />
Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
<br />
And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
<br />
Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
<br />
Home to my house. O most unhappy day!

O most unhappy strumpet!

Master, I am here entered in bond for you.

Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?
<br />

Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:

cry 'The devil!'

<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
<br />

One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?

I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

<p>
<b class="speaker">Officer</b>
Two hundred ducats.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Say, how grows it due?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Officer</b>
Due for a chain your husband had of him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Courtezan</b>
When as your husband all in rage to-day
<br />
Came to my house and took away my ring--
<br />
The ring I saw upon his finger now--
<br />
Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
It may be so, but I did never see it.
<br />
Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
<br />
I long to know the truth hereof at large.

Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us

no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:

methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for

the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of

me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and

turn witch.

I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;

Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

How is the man esteemed here in the city?

<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
Of very reverend reputation, sir,

'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck

Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
<br />
Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
<br />
That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
<br />
And, not without some scandal to yourself,
<br />
With circumstance and oaths so to deny
<br />
This chain which now you wear so openly:
<br />
Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
<br />
You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
<br />
Who, but for staying on our controversy,
<br />
Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
<br />
This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
<br />

<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE</b>
I think I had; I never did deny it.

Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.

How long hath this possession held the man?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
<br />
And much different from the man he was;
<br />
But till this afternoon his passion
<br />
Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEMELIA</b>
Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
<br />
Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
<br />
Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
<br />
A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
<br />
Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
<br />
Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
To none of these, except it be the last;
<br />
Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEMELIA</b>
You should for that have reprehended him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
Why, so I did.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEMELIA</b>
Ay, but not rough enough.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
As roughly as my modesty would let me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEMELIA</b>
Haply, in private.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
And in assemblies too.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEMELIA</b>
Ay, but not enough.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
It was the copy of our conference:
<br />
In bed he slept not for my urging it;
<br />
At board he fed not for my urging it;
<br />
Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
<br />
In company I often glanced it;
<br />
Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEMELIA</b>
And thereof came it that the man was mad.
<br />
The venom clamours of a jealous woman
<br />
Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
<br />
It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
<br />
And therefore comes it that his head is light.
<br />
Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
<br />
Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
<br />
Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
<br />
And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
<br />
Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
<br />
Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
<br />
But moody and dull melancholy,
<br />
Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
<br />
And at her heels a huge infectious troop
<br />
Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
<br />
In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
<br />
To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
<br />
The consequence is then thy jealous fits
<br />
Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
<br />

<p>
<b class="speaker">LUCIANA</b>
She never reprehended him but mildly,
<br />
When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
<br />
Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?

She did betray me to my own reproof.

Good people enter and lay hold on him.

Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEMELIA</b>
Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
<br />
And it shall privilege him from your hands
<br />
Till I have brought him to his wits again,
<br />
Or lose my labour in assaying it.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
<br />
Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
<br />
And will have no attorney but myself;
<br />
And therefore let me have him home with me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEMELIA</b>
Be patient; for I will not let him stir
<br />
Till I have used the approved means I have,
<br />
With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
<br />
To make of him a formal man again:
<br />
It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
<br />
A charitable duty of my order.
<br />
Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ADRIANA</b>
I will not hence and leave my husband here:
<br />
And ill it doth beseem your holiness
<br />
To separate the husband and the wife.

Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.

By this, I think, the dial points at five:

Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person
<br />
Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
<br />
The place of death and sorry execution,
<br />
Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
Upon what cause?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Merchant</b>
To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
<br />
Who put unluckily into this bay
<br />
Against the laws and statutes of this town,
<br />
Beheaded publicly for his offence.

By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
<br />
Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
<br />
Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
<br />
Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
<br />
That here and there his fury had committed.
<br />
Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
<br />
He broke from those that had the guard of him;
<br />
And with his mad attendant and himself,
<br />
Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
<br />
Met us again and madly bent on us,
<br />
Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
<br />
We came again to bind them. Then they fled
<br />
Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
<br />
And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
<br />
And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
<br />
Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
<br />
Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
<br />
Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
<br />
And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
<br />
When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
<br />
To do him all the grace and good I could.
<br />
Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
<br />
And bid the lady abbess come to me.
<br />
I will determine this before I stir.

O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
<br />
My master and his man are both broke loose,
<br />
Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
<br />
Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
<br />
And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
<br />
Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
<br />
My master preaches patience to him and the while
<br />
His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
<br />
And sure, unless you send some present help,
<br />
Between them they will kill the conjurer.

Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;

To scorch your face and to disfigure you.

O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
<br />
In this the madman justly chargeth them.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
My liege, I am advised what I say,
<br />
Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
<br />
Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
<br />
Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
<br />
This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
<br />
That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
<br />
Could witness it, for he was with me then;
<br />
Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
<br />
Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
<br />
Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
<br />
Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
<br />
I went to seek him: in the street I met him
<br />
And in his company that gentleman.
<br />
There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
<br />
That I this day of him received the chain,
<br />
Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
<br />
He did arrest me with an officer.
<br />
I did obey, and sent my peasant home
<br />
For certain ducats: he with none return'd
<br />
Then fairly I bespoke the officer
<br />
To go in person with me to my house.
<br />
By the way we met
<br />
My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
<br />
Of vile confederates. Along with them
<br />
They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
<br />
A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
<br />
A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
<br />
A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
<br />
A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
<br />
Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
<br />
And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
<br />
And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
<br />
Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
<br />
They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
<br />
And in a dark and dankish vault at home
<br />
There left me and my man, both bound together;
<br />
Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
<br />
I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
<br />
Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
<br />
To give me ample satisfaction
<br />
For these deep shames and great indignities.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
<br />
That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
But had he such a chain of thee or no?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANGELO</b>
He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
<br />
These people saw the chain about his neck.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Second Merchant</b>
Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
<br />
Heard you confess you had the chain of him
<br />
After you first forswore it on the mart:
<br />
And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
<br />
And then you fled into this abbey here,
<br />
From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
I never came within these abbey-walls,
<br />
Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
<br />
I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
<br />
And this is false you burden me withal.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
<br />
I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
<br />
If here you housed him, here he would have been;
<br />
If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
<br />
You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
<br />
Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">Courtezan</b>
He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

<p>
<b class="speaker">Courtezan</b>
As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
<br />
I think you are all mated or stark mad.

Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
<br />
</p>

<br />
And is not that your bondman, Dromio?
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
<br />
But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
<br />
Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
<br />
</p>
<p>

I am sure you both of you remember me.

<br />
And careful hours with time's deformed hand

But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
Neither.

</p>

<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
No, trust me, sir, nor I.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
I am sure thou dost.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</b>
Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a

man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
<br />
Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
<br />
In seven short years, that here my only son
<br />
Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
<br />
Though now this grained face of mine be hid
<br />
In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
<br />
And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
<br />
Yet hath my night of life some memory,
<br />
My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
<br />
My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
<br />
All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
<br />
Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
I never saw my father in my life.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
<br />
Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
<br />
Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
<br />
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS</b>
The duke and all that know me in the city
<br />
Can witness with me that it is not so

But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth

By force took Dromio and my son from them

And me they left with those of Epidamnum.

What then became of them I cannot tell

Why, here begins his morning story right;
<br />
These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
<br />
And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
<br />
Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
<br />
These are the parents to these children,
<br />
Which accidentally are met together.

Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?
