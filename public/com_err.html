<h3>SCENE I.  A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace. </h3>
<p class="stagedir">Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other
Attendants</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-3">
Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
And by the doom of death end woes and all.

<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-6">
Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-7">
I am not partial to infringe our laws:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-8">
The enmity and discord which of late
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-9">
Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-10">
To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-11">
Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
For, since the mortal and intestine jars
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
It hath in solemn synods been decreed
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-18">
To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
If any born at Ephesus be seen
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
Again: if any Syracusian born
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-22">
Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-24">
Unless a thousand marks be levied,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-26">
Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-27">
Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-31">
My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-34">
Why thou departed'st from thy native home
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-35">
And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-37">
A heavier task could not have been imposed
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-38">
Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-39">
Yet, that the world may witness that my end
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-40">
Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-40">40</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-41">
I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-42">
In Syracusa was I born, and wed
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-43">
Unto a woman, happy but for me,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-44">
And by me, had not our hap been bad.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-45">
With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-46">
By prosperous voyages I often made
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-47">
To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-48">
And the great care of goods at random left
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-49">
Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-50">
From whom my absence was not six months old
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-51">
Before herself, almost at fainting under
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-52">
The pleasing punishment that women bear,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-53">
Had made provision for her following me
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-54">
And soon and safe arrived where I was.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-55">
There had she not been long, but she became
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-56">
A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-57">
And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-58">
As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-59">
That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-60">
A meaner woman was delivered
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-62">
Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-63">
I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-65">
Made daily motions for our home return:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
We came aboard.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-69">
Before the always wind-obeying deep
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-71">
But longer did we not retain much hope;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-72">
For what obscured light the heavens did grant
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-73">
Did but convey unto our fearful minds
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-74">
A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-75">
Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-76">
Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-77">
Weeping before for what she saw must come,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-78">
And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-79">
That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-80">
Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-80">80</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-81">
And this it was, for other means was none:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-82">
The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-83">
And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-84">
My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-85">
Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-86">
Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-87">
To him one of the other twins was bound,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-88">
Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-89">
The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-90">
Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-90">90</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-91">
Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-92">
And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-93">
Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-94">
At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-95">
Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-96">
And by the benefit of his wished light,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-97">
The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-98">
Two ships from far making amain to us,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-99">
Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-100">
But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-100">100</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-101">
Gather the sequel by that went before.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-103">
Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-104">
For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-106">
O, had the gods done so, I had not now
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-107">
Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-108">
For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-109">
We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-110">
Which being violently borne upon,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-110">110</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-111">
Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-112">
So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-113">
Fortune had left to both of us alike
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-114">
What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-115">
Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-116">
With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-117">
Was carried with more speed before the wind;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-118">
And in our sight they three were taken up
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-119">
By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-120">
At length, another ship had seized on us;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-120">120</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-121">
And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-122">
Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-123">
And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-124">
Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-125">
And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-126">
Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-127">
That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-128">
To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-130">
And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-130">130</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-131">
Do me the favour to dilate at full
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-132">
What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.

<p>
<b class="speaker">AEGEON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-134">
My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-135">
At eighteen years became inquisitive
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-136">
After his brother: and importuned me
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-137">
That his attendant--so his case was like,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-138">
Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-139">
Might bear him company in the quest of him:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-140">
Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-140">140</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-141">
I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-142">
Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-143">
Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-144">
And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-145">
Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-146">
Or that or any place that harbours men.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-147">
But here must end the story of my life;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-148">
And happy were I in my timely death,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-149">
Could all my travels warrant me they live.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DUKE SOLINUS</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-151">
Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-152">
To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-153">
Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-154">
Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,

Which princes, would they, may not disannul,

My soul would sue as advocate for thee.

But, though thou art adjudged to the death

Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-160">160</a>

Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day

Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
