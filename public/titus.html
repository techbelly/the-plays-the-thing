                     I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That this fell fault of my accursed sons,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--

                     If it be proved! you see it is apparent.

                     Coming and going with thy honey breath.
                  
                <br />

                     And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.

                     That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!

                     But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,

                     That could have better sew'd than Philomel.

                     Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He would not then have touch'd them for his life!

                     Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony
                  
                <br />

                     As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.

                     Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.

                     Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?

                     My grief was at the height before thou camest,

                     For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;

                     And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;

                     In bootless prayer have they been held up,

                     And they have served me to effectless use:

                     Is that the one will help to cut the other.

                     'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;

                     Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     As frozen water to a starved snake.

                     Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:

                     Thy other banish'd son, with this dear sight

                     Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,

                     Even like a stony image, cold and numb.

                     Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight

                     And, if you love me, as I think you do,

                     Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!

                     Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,

                     And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;

                     And, when I had it, drew myself apart

                     And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:

                     I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall

                     When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;

                     Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And when I told the empress of this sport,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,

                     And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.

                     Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;

                     Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,

                     That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.

                     O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?

                     I should repent the evils I have done:

                     Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did

                     Would I perform, if I might have my will;
