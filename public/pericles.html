Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,

<p class="stagedir">Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA,

<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-4-3">
My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-4">
And by relating tales of others' griefs,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-5">
See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>
<span class="line" id="0-4-7">
That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-8">
For who digs hills because they do aspire
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-9">
Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-10">
O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
  <a class="line" href="#0-4-10">10</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-11">
Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
</span>

But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.

<p>
<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-4-14">
O Dionyza,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-15">
Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-16">
Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-17">
Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-18">
Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-19">
Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-20">
That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
  <a class="line" href="#0-4-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-21">
They may awake their helps to comfort them.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-22">
I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-23">
And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.

</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>

I'll do my best, sir.

<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-4-27">
This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-28">
A city on whom plenty held full hand,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-29">
For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-30">
Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
  <a class="line" href="#0-4-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-31">
And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-32">
Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-33">
Like one another's glass to trim them by:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-34">
Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-35">
And not so much to feed on as delight;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-36">
All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-37">
The name of help grew odious to repeat.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>

O, 'tis too true.
</span>
</p>

<b class="speaker">CLEON</b>
<span class="line" id="0-4-41">
But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-42">
These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-43">
Were all too little to content and please,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-44">
Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-45">
As houses are defiled for want of use,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-46">
They are now starved for want of exercise:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-47">
Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-48">
Must have inventions to delight the taste,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-49">
Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-50">
Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
  <a class="line" href="#0-4-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-51">
Thought nought too curious, are ready now
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-52">
To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-53">
So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-54">
Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-55">
Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-56">
Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-57">
Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-58">
Is not this true?
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">DIONYZA</b>

Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.

And her prosperities so largely taste,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-4-64">
With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!

Taking advantage of our misery,

Reverend sir,

In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard

Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:

In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,

Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,

Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,

Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
