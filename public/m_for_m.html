                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Till time had made them for us. But it chances

                     Those many had not dared to do that evil,

                     If the first that did the edict infringe

                     Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake

                     Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
                  
                <br />

                     And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
                  
                <br />

                     Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak

                     Be absolute for death; either death or life

                     And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;

                     Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;

                     For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;

                     For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,

                     And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;

                     The mere effusion of thy proper loins,

                     Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     That makes these odds all even.

                     In brief, to set the needless process by,

                     How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion

                     I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For my poor brother's head.

                     In hateful practise. First, his integrity

                     Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason

                     That with such vehemency he should pursue
                  
                <br />

                     My lord, I must confess I know this woman:

                     And five years since there was some speech of marriage

                     Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,

                     Partly for that her promised proportions

                     For that her reputation was disvalued

                     Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,

                     Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?

                     Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?

                     Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,

                     Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power

                     It was the swift celerity of his death,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Which I did think with slower foot came on,

                     That life is better life, past fearing death,
                  
                <br />
