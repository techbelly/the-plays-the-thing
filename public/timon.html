                     Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:

                     I gave it freely ever; and there's none

                     Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     If our betters play at that game, we must not dare

                     And say, you found them in mine honesty.

                     His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,

                     And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,

                     But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.

                     Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
