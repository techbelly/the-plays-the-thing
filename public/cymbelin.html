                     Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.

                     Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--

                     I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd

                     From the spongy south to this part of the west,

                     There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--

                     For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty

                     And in the temple of great Jupiter
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
