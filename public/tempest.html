                     A dozen years; within which space she died

                     It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?

                     This is a strange repose, to be asleep

                     With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     And yet so fast asleep.

                     Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,

                     I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;

                     So fun of valour that they smote the air
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
                  
                <br />
             
          
             
               
                  
                     At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd

                     As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
                  
                <br />
