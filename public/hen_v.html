      <h3>SCENE I.  London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace. </h3>
          <p class="stagedir">Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY</p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,                <br />
                     Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign                <br />
                     Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,                <br />
                     But that the scambling and unquiet time                <br />
                     Did push it out of farther question.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ELY</b>
                     But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     It must be thought on. If it pass against us,                <br />
                     We lose the better half of our possession:                <br />
                     For all the temporal lands which men devout                <br />
                     By testament have given to the church                <br />
                     Would they strip from us; being valued thus:                <br />
                     As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,                <br />
                     Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,                <br />
                     Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;                <br />
                     And, to relief of lazars and weak age,                <br />
                     Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.                <br />
                     A hundred almshouses right well supplied;                <br />
                     And to the coffers of the king beside,                <br />
                     A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ELY</b>
                     This would drink deep.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     'Twould drink the cup and all.                <br />

                     But what prevention?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     The king is full of grace and fair regard.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">ELY</b>
                     And a true lover of the holy church.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     The courses of his youth promised it not.                <br />
                     The breath no sooner left his father's body,                <br />
                     But that his wildness, mortified in him,                <br />
                     Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment                <br />
                     Consideration, like an angel, came                <br />
                     And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,                <br />
                     Leaving his body as a paradise,                <br />
                     To envelop and contain celestial spirits.                <br />
                     Never was such a sudden scholar made;                <br />
                     Never came reformation in a flood,                <br />
                     With such a heady currance, scouring faults                <br />
                     Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness                <br />
                     So soon did lose his seat and all at once                <br />
                     As in this king.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ELY</b>
                     We are blessed in the change.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     Hear him but reason in divinity,                <br />
                     And all-admiring with an inward wish                <br />
                     You would desire the king were made a prelate:                <br />
                     Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,                <br />
                     You would say it hath been all in all his study:                <br />
                     List his discourse of war, and you shall hear                <br />
                     A fearful battle render'd you in music:                <br />
                     Turn him to any cause of policy,                <br />
                     The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,                <br />
                     Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,                <br />
                     The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,                <br />
                     And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,                <br />
                     To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;                <br />
                     So that the art and practic part of life                <br />
                     Must be the mistress to this theoric:                <br />
                     Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,                <br />
                     Since his addiction was to courses vain,                <br />
                     His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,                <br />
                     His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,                <br />
                     And never noted in him any study,                <br />
                     Any retirement, any sequestration                <br />
                     From open haunts and popularity.                <br />

                     The strawberry grows underneath the nettle                <br />
                     And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best                <br />
                     Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:                <br />
                     And so the prince obscured his contemplation                <br />
                     Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,                <br />
                     Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,                <br />
                     Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     It must be so; for miracles are ceased;                <br />
                     And therefore we must needs admit the means                <br />
                     How things are perfected.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ELY</b>
                     But, my good lord,                <br />
                     How now for mitigation of this bill                <br />
                     Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty                <br />
                     Incline to it, or no?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     He seems indifferent,                <br />
                     Or rather swaying more upon our part                <br />
                     Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;                <br />
                     For I have made an offer to his majesty,                <br />
                     Upon our spiritual convocation                <br />
                     And in regard of causes now in hand,                <br />
                     Which I have open'd to his grace at large,                <br />
                     As touching France, to give a greater sum                <br />
                     Than ever at one time the clergy yet                <br />
                     Did to his predecessors part withal.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ELY</b>
                     How did this offer seem received, my lord?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     With good acceptance of his majesty;                <br />
                     Save that there was not time enough to hear,                <br />
                     As I perceived his grace would fain have done,                <br />
                     The severals and unhidden passages                <br />
                     Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms                <br />
                     And generally to the crown and seat of France                <br />
                     Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ELY</b>
                     What was the impediment that broke this off?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     The French ambassador upon that instant                <br />
                     Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come                <br />
                     To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ELY</b>
                     It is.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">CANTERBURY</b>
                     Then go we in, to know his embassy;                <br />
                     Which I could with a ready guess declare,                <br />
                     Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ELY</b>
                     I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.                <br />

                     My learned lord, we pray you to proceed                <br />
                     And justly and religiously unfold                <br />

                     And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,                <br />
                     That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,                <br />
                     Or nicely charge your understanding soul                <br />
                     With opening titles miscreate, whose right                <br />
                     Suits not in native colours with the truth;                <br />
                     For God doth know how many now in health                <br />
                     Shall drop their blood in approbation                <br />
                     Of what your reverence shall incite us to.                <br />
                     Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,                <br />
                     How you awake our sleeping sword of war:                <br />

                     Are every one a woe, a sore complaint                <br />
                     'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords                <br />
                     That make such waste in brief mortality.                <br />
                     Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;                <br />
                     For we will hear, note and believe in heart                <br />

                     Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,                <br />
                     That owe yourselves, your lives and services                <br />
                     To this imperial throne. There is no bar                <br />
                     To make against your highness' claim to France                <br />
                     But this, which they produce from Pharamond,                <br />
                     'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'                <br />
                     'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'                <br />
                     Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze                <br />
                     To be the realm of France, and Pharamond                <br />
                     The founder of this law and female bar.                <br />
                     Yet their own authors faithfully affirm                <br />
                     That the land Salique is in Germany,                <br />
                     Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;                <br />
                     Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,                <br />
                     There left behind and settled certain French;                <br />
                     Who, holding in disdain the German women                <br />
                     For some dishonest manners of their life,                <br />
                     Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female                <br />
                     Should be inheritrix in Salique land:                <br />
                     Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,                <br />
                     Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.                <br />
                     Then doth it well appear that Salique law                <br />
                     Was not devised for the realm of France:                <br />
                     Nor did the French possess the Salique land                <br />
                     Until four hundred one and twenty years                <br />
                     After defunction of King Pharamond,                <br />
                     Idly supposed the founder of this law;                <br />
                     Who died within the year of our redemption                <br />
                     Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great                <br />
                     Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French                <br />
                     Beyond the river Sala, in the year                <br />
                     Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,                <br />
                     King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,                <br />
                     Did, as heir general, being descended                <br />
                     Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,                <br />
                     Make claim and title to the crown of France.                <br />
                     Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown                <br />
                     Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male                <br />
                     Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,                <br />
                     To find his title with some shows of truth,                <br />
                     'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,                <br />
                     Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,                <br />
                     Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son                <br />
                     To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son                <br />
                     Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,                <br />
                     Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,                <br />
                     Could not keep quiet in his conscience,                <br />
                     Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied                <br />
                     That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,                <br />
                     Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,                <br />
                     Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:                <br />
                     By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great                <br />
                     Was re-united to the crown of France.                <br />
                     So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.                <br />
                     King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,                <br />
                     King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear                <br />
                     To hold in right and title of the female:                <br />
                     So do the kings of France unto this day;                <br />
                     Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law                <br />
                     To bar your highness claiming from the female,                <br />
                     And rather choose to hide them in a net                <br />
                     Than amply to imbar their crooked titles                <br />
                     Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.                <br />

                     Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,                <br />
                     And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.                <br />
                     While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,                <br />
                     The advised head defends itself at home;                <br />
                     For government, though high and low and lower,                <br />

                     Setting endeavour in continual motion;                <br />
                     To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,                <br />

                     Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,                <br />
                     Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,                <br />
                     Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,                <br />
                     Which pillage they with merry march bring home                <br />
                     To the tent-royal of their emperor;                <br />
                     Who, busied in his majesty, surveys                <br />
                     The singing masons building roofs of gold,                <br />
                     The civil citizens kneading up the honey,                <br />

                     The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,                <br />
                     That many things, having full reference                <br />
                     To one consent, may work contrariously:                <br />
                     As many arrows, loosed several ways,                <br />
                     Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;                <br />
                     As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;                <br />
                     As many lines close in the dial's centre;                <br />
                     So may a thousand actions, once afoot.                <br />
                     End in one purpose, and be all well borne                <br />
                     Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.                <br />
                     Divide your happy England into four;                <br />
                     Whereof take you one quarter into France,                <br />
                     And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.                <br />

                     Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,                <br />

                     Thus, then, in few.                <br />
                     Your highness, lately sending into France,                <br />
                     Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right                <br />
                     Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.                <br />
                     In answer of which claim, the prince our master                <br />
                     Says that you savour too much of your youth,                <br />
                     And bids you be advised there's nought in France                <br />
                     That can be with a nimble galliard won;                <br />
                     You cannot revel into dukedoms there.                <br />
                     He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,                <br />
                     This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,                <br />
                     Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim                <br />
                     Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;                <br />
                     His present and your pains we thank you for:                <br />
                     When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,                <br />
                     We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set                <br />
                     Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.                <br />
                     Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler                <br />
                     That all the courts of France will be disturb'd                <br />
                     With chaces. And we understand him well,                <br />
                     How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,                <br />
                     Not measuring what use we made of them.                <br />
                     We never valued this poor seat of England;                <br />
                     And therefore, living hence, did give ourself                <br />
                     To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common                <br />
                     That men are merriest when they are from home.                <br />
                     But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,                <br />
                     Be like a king and show my sail of greatness                <br />
                     When I do rouse me in my throne of France:                <br />
                     For that I have laid by my majesty                <br />
                     And plodded like a man for working-days,                <br />
                     But I will rise there with so full a glory                <br />
                     That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,                <br />
                     Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.                <br />
                     And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his                <br />
                     Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul                <br />
                     Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance                <br />
                     That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows                <br />
                     Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;                <br />
                     Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;                <br />
                     And some are yet ungotten and unborn                <br />
                     That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.                <br />
                     But this lies all within the will of God,                <br />
                     To whom I do appeal; and in whose name                <br />
                     Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,                <br />
                     To venge me as I may and to put forth                <br />
                     My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.                <br />
                     So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin                <br />
                     His jest will savour but of shallow wit,                <br />
                     When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.                <br />
                     Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.                <br />

                     what though? it will toast cheese, and it will                <br />
                     endure cold as another man's sword will: and                <br />

                     How smooth and even they do bear themselves!                <br />
                     As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,                <br />

                     Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,                <br />
                     That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell                <br />

                     Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.                <br />
                     My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,                <br />
                     And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:                <br />
                     Think you not that the powers we bear with us                <br />
                     Will cut their passage through the force of France,                <br />
                     Doing the execution and the act                <br />
                     For which we have in head assembled them?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SCROOP</b>
                     No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded                <br />
                     We carry not a heart with us from hence                <br />
                     That grows not in a fair consent with ours,                <br />
                     Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish                <br />
                     Success and conquest to attend on us.                <br />

                     Never was monarch better fear'd and loved                <br />
                     Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject                <br />
                     That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness                <br />
                     Under the sweet shade of your government.                <br />

                     True: those that were your father's enemies                <br />
                     Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you                <br />
                     With hearts create of duty and of zeal.                <br />

                     We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;                <br />
                     And shall forget the office of our hand,                <br />
                     Sooner than quittance of desert and merit                <br />

                     And labour shall refresh itself with hope,                <br />
                     To do your grace incessant services.                <br />

                     We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,                <br />
                     Enlarge the man committed yesterday,                <br />
                     That rail'd against our person: we consider                <br />
                     it was excess of wine that set him on;                <br />
                     And on his more advice we pardon him.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">SCROOP</b>
                     That's mercy, but too much security:                <br />
                     Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example                <br />
                     Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>

          <p>

                     Sir,                <br />
                     You show great mercy, if you give him life,                <br />
                     After the taste of much correction.                <br />

                     Alas, your too much love and care of me                <br />
                     Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!                <br />
                     If little faults, proceeding on distemper,                <br />
                     Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye                <br />
                     When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,                <br />
                     Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,                <br />
                     Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care                <br />
                     And tender preservation of our person,                <br />
                     Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:                <br />
                     Who are the late commissioners?                <br />

                     What see you in those papers that you lose                <br />
                     So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!                <br />
                     Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there                <br />
                     That hath so cowarded and chased your blood                <br />
                     Out of appearance?                <br />

                     The mercy that was quick in us but late,                <br />
                     By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:                <br />
                     You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;                <br />
                     For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,                <br />
                     As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.                <br />
                     See you, my princes, and my noble peers,                <br />
                     These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,                <br />
                     You know how apt our love was to accord                <br />
                     To furnish him with all appertinents                <br />
                     Belonging to his honour; and this man                <br />
                     Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,                <br />
                     And sworn unto the practises of France,                <br />
                     To kill us here in Hampton: to the which                <br />
                     This knight, no less for bounty bound to us                <br />
                     Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,                <br />
                     What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,                <br />
                     Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!                <br />
                     Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,                <br />
                     That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,                <br />
                     That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,                <br />
                     Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,                <br />
                     May it be possible, that foreign hire                <br />
                     Could out of thee extract one spark of evil                <br />
                     That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,                <br />
                     That, though the truth of it stands off as gross                <br />
                     As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.                <br />
                     Treason and murder ever kept together,                <br />
                     As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,                <br />
                     Working so grossly in a natural cause,                <br />
                     That admiration did not whoop at them:                <br />
                     But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in                <br />
                     Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:                <br />
                     And whatsoever cunning fiend it was                <br />
                     That wrought upon thee so preposterously                <br />
                     Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:                <br />
                     All other devils that suggest by treasons                <br />
                     Do botch and bungle up damnation                <br />
                     With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd                <br />
                     From glistering semblances of piety;                <br />
                     But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,                <br />
                     Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,                <br />
                     Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.                <br />
                     If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus                <br />
                     Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,                <br />
                     He might return to vasty Tartar back,                <br />
                     And tell the legions 'I can never win                <br />
                     A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'                <br />
                     O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected                <br />
                     The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?                <br />
                     Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?                <br />
                     Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?                <br />
                     Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?                <br />
                     Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,                <br />
                     Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,                <br />
                     Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,                <br />

                     I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with                <br />

                     a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,                <br />

                     four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'                <br />
                     should not think of God; I hoped there was no need                <br />

                     My most redoubted father,                <br />
                     It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;                <br />
                     For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,                <br />
                     Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,                <br />
                     But that defences, musters, preparations,                <br />
                     Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,                <br />
                     As were a war in expectation.                <br />
                     Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth                <br />
                     To view the sick and feeble parts of France:                <br />
                     And let us do it with no show of fear;                <br />
                     No, with no more than if we heard that England                <br />
                     Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:                <br />
                     For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,                <br />
                     Her sceptre so fantastically borne                <br />
                     By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,                <br />
                     That fear attends her not.                <br />

                     O peace, Prince Dauphin!                <br />
                     You are too much mistaken in this king:                <br />
                     Question your grace the late ambassadors,                <br />
                     With what great state he heard their embassy,                <br />
                     How well supplied with noble counsellors,                <br />
                     How modest in exception, and withal                <br />
                     How terrible in constant resolution,                <br />
                     And you shall find his vanities forespent                <br />
                     Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,                <br />
                     Covering discretion with a coat of folly;                <br />
                     As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots                <br />

                     Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;                <br />
                     But though we think it so, it is no matter:                <br />
                     In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh                <br />
                     The enemy more mighty than he seems:                <br />
                     So the proportions of defence are fill'd;                <br />
                     Which of a weak or niggardly projection                <br />
                     Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting                <br />

                     The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;                <br />

                     Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it                <br />

                     As young as I am, I have observed these three                <br />
                     swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they                <br />
                     three, though they would serve me, could not be man                <br />
                     to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to                <br />
                     a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and                <br />
                     red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but                <br />
                     fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue                <br />
                     and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks                <br />
                     words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath                <br />
                     heard that men of few words are the best men; and                <br />
                     therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'                <br />
                     should be thought a coward: but his few bad words                <br />
                     are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never                <br />
                     broke any man's head but his own, and that was                <br />
                     against a post when he was drunk. They will steal                <br />
                     any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a                <br />
                     lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for                <br />
                     three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn                <br />
                     brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a                <br />
                     fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the                <br />
                     men would carry coals. They would have me as                <br />
                     familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their                <br />
                     handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,                <br />
                     if I should take from another's pocket to put into                <br />
                     mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I                <br />
                     must leave them, and seek some better service:                <br />
                     their villany goes against my weak stomach, and                <br />
                     therefore I must cast it up.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     How yet resolves the governor of the town?                <br />
                     This is the latest parle we will admit;                <br />
                     Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;                <br />
                     Or like to men proud of destruction                <br />
                     Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,                <br />
                     A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,                <br />
                     If I begin the battery once again,                <br />
                     I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur                <br />
                     Till in her ashes she lie buried.                <br />
                     The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,                <br />
                     And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,                <br />
                     In liberty of bloody hand shall range                <br />
                     With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass                <br />
                     Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.                <br />
                     What is it then to me, if impious war,                <br />
                     Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,                <br />
                     Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats                <br />
                     Enlink'd to waste and desolation?                <br />
                     What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,                <br />
                     If your pure maidens fall into the hand                <br />
                     Of hot and forcing violation?                <br />
                     What rein can hold licentious wickedness                <br />
                     When down the hill he holds his fierce career?                <br />
                     We may as bootless spend our vain command                <br />
                     Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil                <br />
                     As send precepts to the leviathan                <br />
                     To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,                <br />
                     Take pity of your town and of your people,                <br />
                     Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;                <br />
                     Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace                <br />
                     O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds                <br />
                     Of heady murder, spoil and villany.                <br />
                     If not, why, in a moment look to see                <br />
                     The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand                <br />
                     Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;                <br />
                     Your fathers taken by the silver beards,                <br />
                     And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,                <br />
                     Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,                <br />
                     Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused                <br />
                     Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry                <br />
                     At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.                <br />
                     What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,                <br />
                     Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?                <br />

                     And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,                <br />
                     And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,                <br />
                     That goddess blind,                <br />

                     By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is                <br />
                     painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to                <br />
                     signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is                <br />
                     painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which                <br />
                     is the moral of it, that she is turning, and                <br />
                     inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her                <br />
                     foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,                <br />
                     which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,                <br />
                     the poet makes a most excellent description of it:                <br />
                     Fortune is an excellent moral.                <br />

                     Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;                <br />
                     For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:                <br />
                     A damned death!                <br />
                     Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free                <br />
                     And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:                <br />
                     But Exeter hath given the doom of death                <br />
                     For pax of little price.                <br />
                     Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:                <br />
                     And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut                <br />
                     With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:                <br />
                     Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.                <br />

                     could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we                <br />
                     thought not good to bruise an injury till it were                <br />
                     full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice                <br />
                     is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see                <br />

                     For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the                <br />
                     effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too                <br />
                     faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own                <br />

                     My numbers lessened, and those few I have                <br />
                     Almost no better than so many French;                <br />
                     Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,                <br />
                     I thought upon one pair of English legs                <br />
                     Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,                <br />
                     That I do brag thus! This your air of France                <br />
                     Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.                <br />
                     Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;                <br />
                     My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,                <br />
                     My army but a weak and sickly guard;                <br />
                     Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,                <br />
                     Though France himself and such another neighbour                <br />
                     Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.                <br />
                     Go bid thy master well advise himself:                <br />
                     If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,                <br />
                     We shall your tawny ground with your red blood                <br />
                     Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.                <br />
                     The sum of all our answer is but this:                <br />
                     We would not seek a battle, as we are;                <br />
                     Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:                <br />
                     So tell your master.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Constable</b>
                     Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ORLEANS</b>
                     You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Constable</b>
                     It is the best horse of Europe.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ORLEANS</b>
                     Will it never be morning?                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you                <br />
                     talk of horse and armour?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ORLEANS</b>
                     You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     What a long night is this! I will not change my                <br />
                     horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.                <br />
                     Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his                <br />
                     entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,                <br />
                     chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I                <br />
                     soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth                <br />
                     sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his                <br />
                     hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ORLEANS</b>
                     He's of the colour of the nutmeg.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for                <br />
                     Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull                <br />
                     elements of earth and water never appear in him, but                <br />
                     only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts                <br />
                     him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you                <br />
                     may call beasts.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Constable</b>
                     Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ORLEANS</b>
                     No more, cousin.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the                <br />
                     rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary                <br />
                     deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as                <br />
                     fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent                <br />
                     tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:                <br />
                     'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for                <br />
                     a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the                <br />
                     world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart                <br />
                     their particular functions and wonder at him. I                <br />
                     once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:                <br />
                     'Wonder of nature,'--                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ORLEANS</b>
                     I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     Then did they imitate that which I composed to my                <br />
                     courser, for my horse is my mistress.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">ORLEANS</b>
                     Your mistress bears well.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     Me well; which is the prescript praise and                <br />
                     perfection of a good and particular mistress.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Constable</b>
                     Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly                <br />
                     shook your back.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     So perhaps did yours.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Constable</b>
                     Mine was not bridled.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,                <br />
                     like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in                <br />
                     your straight strossers.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Constable</b>
                     You have good judgment in horsemanship.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride                <br />
                     not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have                <br />
                     my horse to my mistress.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Constable</b>
                     I had as lief have my mistress a jade.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">DAUPHIN</b>
                     I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">Constable</b>
                     I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow                <br />
                     to my mistress.                <br />

                     A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I                <br />
                     pray you, what thinks he of our estate?                <br />

                     washed off the next tide.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">BATES</b>
                     He hath not told his thought to the king?                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I                <br />
                     speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I                <br />
                     am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the                <br />
                     element shows to him as it doth to me; all his                <br />
                     senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies                <br />
                     laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and                <br />
                     though his affections are higher mounted than ours,                <br />
                     yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like                <br />
                     wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we                <br />
                     do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish                <br />
                     as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess                <br />
                     him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing                <br />
                     it, should dishearten his army.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BATES</b>
                     He may show what outward courage he will; but I                <br />
                     believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish                <br />
                     himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he                <br />
                     were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:                <br />
                     I think he would not wish himself any where but                <br />
                     where he is.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BATES</b>
                     Then I would he were here alone; so should he be                <br />
                     sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here                <br />
                     alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's                <br />
                     minds: methinks I could not die any where so                <br />
                     contented as in the king's company; his cause being                <br />
                     just and his quarrel honourable.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WILLIAMS</b>
                     That's more than we know.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">BATES</b>
                     Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know                <br />
                     enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if                <br />
                     his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes                <br />
                     the crime of it out of us.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">WILLIAMS</b>
                     But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath                <br />
                     a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and                <br />
                     arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join                <br />
                     together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at                <br />
                     such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a                <br />
                     surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind                <br />
                     them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their                <br />
                     children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die                <br />
                     well that die in a battle; for how can they                <br />
                     charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their                <br />
                     argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it                <br />
                     will be a black matter for the king that led them to                <br />
                     it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of                <br />
                     subjection.                <br />
          </p>
          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     So, if a son that is by his father sent about                <br />
                     merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the                <br />

                     imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a                <br />
                     servant, under his master's command transporting a                <br />
                     sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in                <br />
                     many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the                <br />
                     business of the master the author of the servant's                <br />
                     damnation: but this is not so: the king is not                <br />
                     bound to answer the particular endings of his                <br />
                     soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of                <br />
                     his servant; for they purpose not their death, when                <br />
                     they purpose their services. Besides, there is no                <br />
                     king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to                <br />
                     the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all                <br />
                     unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them                <br />
                     the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;                <br />
                     some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of                <br />
                     perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that                <br />
                     have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with                <br />
                     pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have                <br />
                     defeated the law and outrun native punishment,                <br />
                     though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to                <br />
                     fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;                <br />
                     so that here men are punished for before-breach of                <br />
                     the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where                <br />
                     they feared the death, they have borne life away;                <br />
                     and where they would be safe, they perish: then if                <br />
                     they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of                <br />
                     their damnation than he was before guilty of those                <br />
                     impieties for the which they are now visited. Every                <br />
                     subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's                <br />
                     soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in                <br />
                     the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every                <br />
                     mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death                <br />
                     is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was                <br />
                     blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:                <br />
                     and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think                <br />
                     that, making God so free an offer, He let him                <br />
                     outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach                <br />
                     others how they should prepare.                <br />

                     one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their                <br />

                     We must bear all. O hard condition,                <br />
                     Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath                <br />
                     Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel                <br />
                     But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease                <br />
                     Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!                <br />
                     And what have kings, that privates have not too,                <br />
                     Save ceremony, save general ceremony?                <br />
                     And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?                <br />
                     What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more                <br />
                     Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?                <br />
                     What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?                <br />
                     O ceremony, show me but thy worth!                <br />
                     What is thy soul of adoration?                <br />
                     Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,                <br />
                     Creating awe and fear in other men?                <br />
                     Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd                <br />
                     Than they in fearing.                <br />
                     What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,                <br />
                     But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,                <br />
                     And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!                <br />
                     Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out                <br />
                     With titles blown from adulation?                <br />
                     Will it give place to flexure and low bending?                <br />
                     Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,                <br />
                     Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,                <br />
                     That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;                <br />

                     'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,                <br />

                     The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,                <br />
                     The farced title running 'fore the king,                <br />

                     That beats upon the high shore of this world,                <br />
                     No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,                <br />
                     Not all these, laid in bed majestical,                <br />

                     Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots                <br />
                     What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     I pray thee, bear my former answer back:                <br />
                     Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.                <br />
                     Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?                <br />
                     The man that once did sell the lion's skin                <br />
                     While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.                <br />

                     Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,                <br />
                     Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:                <br />
                     And those that leave their valiant bones in France,                <br />
                     Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,                <br />
                     They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,                <br />
                     And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;                <br />
                     Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,                <br />
                     The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.                <br />
                     Mark then abounding valour in our English,                <br />
                     That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,                <br />

                     Killing in relapse of mortality.                <br />
                     Let me speak proudly: tell the constable                <br />
                     We are but warriors for the working-day;                <br />
                     Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd                <br />
                     With rainy marching in the painful field;                <br />
                     There's not a piece of feather in our host--                <br />
                     Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--                <br />
                     And time hath worn us into slovenry:                <br />
                     But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;                <br />
                     And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night                <br />
                     They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck                <br />
                     The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads                <br />
                     And turn them out of service. If they do this,--                <br />
                     As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then                <br />
                     Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;                <br />
                     Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:                <br />
                     They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;                <br />
                     Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,                <br />
                     Shall yield them little, tell the constable.                <br />

                     The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.                <br />
                     Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,                <br />
                     Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,                <br />
                     And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes                <br />

                     My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;                <br />
                     Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,                <br />
                     As in this glorious and well-foughten field                <br />

                     He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,                <br />
                     And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,                <br />
                     Commend my service to me sovereign.'                <br />
                     So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck                <br />
                     He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;                <br />
                     And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd                <br />

                     Our king is not like him in that: he never killed                <br />

                     Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his                <br />
                     ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in                <br />
                     his right wits and his good judgments, turned away                <br />
                     the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he                <br />
                     was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and                <br />

                     As we are now glad to behold your eyes;                <br />
                     Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them                <br />
                     Against the French, that met them in their bent,                <br />
                     The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:                <br />
                     The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,                <br />
                     Have lost their quality, and that this day                <br />

                     My duty to you both, on equal love,                <br />
                     Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd,                <br />
                     With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,                <br />
                     To bring your most imperial majesties                <br />
                     Unto this bar and royal interview,                <br />
                     Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.                <br />
                     Since then my office hath so far prevail'd                <br />
                     That, face to face and royal eye to eye,                <br />
                     You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,                <br />
                     If I demand, before this royal view,                <br />
                     What rub or what impediment there is,                <br />
                     Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,                <br />
                     Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,                <br />
                     Should not in this best garden of the world                <br />
                     Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?                <br />
                     Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,                <br />
                     And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,                <br />
                     Corrupting in its own fertility.                <br />
                     Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,                <br />
                     Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,                <br />
                     Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,                <br />
                     Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas                <br />
                     The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory                <br />
                     Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts                <br />
                     That should deracinate such savagery;                <br />
                     The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth                <br />
                     The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,                <br />
                     Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,                <br />
                     Conceives by idleness and nothing teems                <br />
                     But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,                <br />
                     Losing both beauty and utility.                <br />
                     And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,                <br />
                     Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,                <br />
                     Even so our houses and ourselves and children                <br />
                     Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,                <br />
                     The sciences that should become our country;                <br />
                     But grow like savages,--as soldiers will                <br />
                     That nothing do but meditate on blood,--                <br />
                     To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire                <br />
                     And every thing that seems unnatural.                <br />
                     Which to reduce into our former favour                <br />
                     You are assembled: and my speech entreats                <br />
                     That I may know the let, why gentle Peace                <br />
                     Should not expel these inconveniences                <br />
                     And bless us with her former qualities.                <br />

                     Which you have cited, you must buy that peace                <br />

                     The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,                <br />
                     Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am                <br />
                     glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if                <br />

                     crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but                <br />
                     directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me                <br />
                     farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out                <br />
                     my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so                <br />

                     Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for                <br />
                     your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I                <br />
                     have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I                <br />
                     have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable                <br />
                     measure in strength. If I could win a lady at                <br />
                     leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my                <br />
                     armour on my back, under the correction of bragging                <br />
                     be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.                <br />
                     Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse                <br />
                     for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and                <br />
                     sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,                <br />
                     Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my                <br />
                     eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;                <br />
                     only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,                <br />
                     nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a                <br />
                     fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth                <br />
                     sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love                <br />
                     of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy                <br />
                     cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst                <br />
                     love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee                <br />
                     that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the                <br />
                     Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou                <br />
                     livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and                <br />
                     uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee                <br />
                     right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other                <br />
                     places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that                <br />
                     can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do                <br />
                     always reason themselves out again. What! a                <br />
                     speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A                <br />
                     good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a                <br />
                     black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow                <br />
                     bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax                <br />
                     hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the                <br />
                     moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it                <br />
                     shines bright and never changes, but keeps his                <br />
                     course truly. If thou would have such a one, take                <br />
                     me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,                <br />
                     take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?                <br />
                     speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.                <br />

          <p>
            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of                <br />
                     France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love                <br />
                     the friend of France; for I love France so well that                <br />
                     I will not part with a village of it; I will have it                <br />
                     all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am                <br />
                     yours, then yours is France and you are mine.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am                <br />
                     sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married                <br />
                     wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook                <br />
                     off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand                <br />
                     vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what                <br />
                     then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est                <br />
                     France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,                <br />
                     Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much                <br />
                     more French: I shall never move thee in French,                <br />
                     unless it be to laugh at me.                <br />

                     est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my                <br />
                     tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs                <br />
                     be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou                <br />
                     understand thus much English, canst thou love me?                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask                <br />
                     them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,                <br />
                     when you come into your closet, you'll question this                <br />
                     gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to                <br />
                     her dispraise those parts in me that you love with                <br />
                     your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the                <br />
                     rather, gentle princess, because I love thee                <br />
                     cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a                <br />
                     saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get                <br />
                     thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs                <br />
                     prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,                <br />
                     between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a                <br />
                     boy, half French, half English, that shall go to                <br />
                     Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?                <br />
                     shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair                <br />

                     Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in                <br />
                     true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I                <br />
                     dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to                <br />
                     flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor                <br />
                     and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew                <br />
                     my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars                <br />
                     when he got me: therefore was I created with a                <br />
                     stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when                <br />
                     I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,                <br />
                     Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:                <br />
                     my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of                <br />
                     beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou                <br />
                     hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou                <br />
                     shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:                <br />
                     and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you                <br />
                     have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the                <br />
                     thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;                <br />
                     take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am                <br />

                     thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.                <br />

                     before they are married, would she say?                <br />

                     O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear                <br />
                     Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak                <br />
                     list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of                <br />
                     manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our                <br />
                     places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will                <br />
                     do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your                <br />
                     country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently                <br />
                     and yielding.                <br />

                     You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is                <br />
                     more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the                <br />
                     tongues of the French council; and they should                <br />

                     I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how                <br />
                     perfectly I love her; and that is good English.                <br />

                     Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not                <br />
                     smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the                <br />
                     heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up                <br />
                     the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in                <br />

                     Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you                <br />
                     for that. If you would conjure in her, you must                <br />
                     make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true                <br />

                     blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the                <br />
                     virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the                <br />

                     self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid                <br />
                     to consign to.                <br />

            <b class="speaker">KING HENRY V</b>
                     Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.                <br />

                     I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will                <br />

                     eyes; and then they will endure handling, which                <br />
                     before would not abide looking on.                <br />

                     my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city                <br />
