Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-4">
That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-5">
As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

'Sblood, but you will not hear me:

If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.

<span class="line" id="0-0-12">
Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-13">
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-14">
Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-15">
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-16">
But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-17">
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-18">
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-19">
And, in conclusion,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-20">
Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-20">20</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-21">
'I have already chose my officer.'
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-22">
And what was he?
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-23">
Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-24">
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-25">
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-26">
That never set a squadron in the field,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-27">
Nor the division of a battle knows
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-28">
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-29">
Wherein the toged consuls can propose
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-30">
As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-30">30</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-31">
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-32">
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-33">
At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-34">
Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-35">
By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-36">
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-37">
And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.

<b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>

By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">IAGO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-41">
Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-42">
Preferment goes by letter and affection,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-43">
And not by old gradation, where each second
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-44">
Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-45">
Whether I in any just term am affined
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-46">
To love the Moor.
</span>
</p>
<p>
<b class="speaker">RODERIGO</b>
<span class="line" id="0-0-48">
I would not follow him then.

O, sir, content you;
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-50">50</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-51">
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-52">
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-53">
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-54">
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-55">
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-56">
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-57">
For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-58">
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-59">
Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-60">
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-60">60</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-61">
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-62">
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-63">
their coats
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-64">
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-65">
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-66">
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-67">
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-68">
In following him, I follow but myself;
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-69">
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-70">
But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
  <a class="line" href="#0-0-70">70</a>
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-71">
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-72">
The native act and figure of my heart
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-73">
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-74">
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
</span>
<span class="line" id="0-0-75">
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

What a full fortune does the thicklips owe

Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,

Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,

And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,

Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,

Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,

Transported, with no worse nor better guard

There comes a fellow crying out for help:
</span>
<span class="line" id="1-2-319">
And Cassio following him with determined sword,

Myself the crying fellow did pursue,

Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--

Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather

For this was brief--I found them close together,

At blow and thrust; even as again they were
